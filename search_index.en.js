Dasan\nAbout me\nHi! My name is Naren. I am from Colorado, did my undergrad at the University of Illinois and after a stint in San Francisco working on the development of self driving cars, I completed my masters from USC.\nI've worked on topics ranging from climate modeling, high performance computing, user interface design, computer vision and embedded and operating systems but since I was in high school I have most passionate about thinking about and developing the ways one or many people and one or many robots interact with each other (i.e. human robot interaction, swarm robotics, multi-agent systems, and artificial intelligence). Hence a good amount of my academic research is centered around these ideas.\nI am also an advocate for Free and Open Source Software and Hardware. During my undergrad, I, along with a couple close collaborators worked on extending the ideas of the hackathon craze of the 2010s to address getting more students involved in the open source community. This resulted in HackIllinois becoming (to my knowledge) the first open source collegiate hackathon. Growing from a small pilot program to 1000+ attendees a year, over the last 4 years 100s of Pull Requests, a few releases, and a whole lot of cool new open source projects and forks were created at Hackillinois, a lot done by first time open source contributors being mentored by core maintainers of projects like Debian, Rust, WebAssembly, Python, Julia and more.\nIn my free time I'm an avid biker switching between mountain, gravel and road frequently as well as like to play tennis, soccer and rugby (have caps for both Illinois and USC). I was chair of the UIUC Chapter of ACM from 2016-2017, ACM@UIUC being the nations largest ACM student chapter and during my time there I created quite a few projects that ACM now maintain.\nI work at NVIDIA developing perception and other deep learning components for autonomous vehicles within the constraints of the resource limited environment of a car. I therefore use TensorRT a lot and ended up creating the TensorRT Python API and worked on the open sourcing effort for TensorRT. I also created and am the lead maintainer of TRTorch now Torch-Tensorrt, a compiler for PyTorch that targets NVIDIA GPUs via TensorRT. You can see a hint of the perception work we do by looking at NVIDIA's DevBlog.\nAt USC, I worked at the ICAROS Lab lead by Prof. Stefanos Nikolaidis. My research centers focuses on a couple aspects of developing human compatible robots. One of my main thrusts is in enabling robots to quickly learn the workflow preferences of their human counterparts in collaborative tasks. Another of my thrusts is in leveraging quality and diversity algorithms to train more robust agents.\nI now am a Ph.D student at the University of Colorado Boulder advised by Prof. Alessandro Roncone. I am continuing my research in developing human compatible robotics focusing most on robot systems that can flexibly adapt their policies to be more compliant to their human or other robot collaborators. As such I continue use techiques like quality diversity\nalgorithms and few shot meta learning in the service of this goal.\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/about/","title":"About"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/","title":"Blog"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/3dfs/":{"body":"\n\nFrom video to 3D model automatically\n\nDuring my time working in the UIUC Vision Group with Prof. Hoiem I worked on 3DFS (Deformable Dense Depth Fusion and Segmentation).\n3DFS is a 3D reconstruction and segmentation system from standard video.\n\n\nThe processing stages of 3DFS in order to go from video to object reconstruction and segmentation masks\n\nUsers can take a video filming different angles of an object,\n3DFS then goes through four stages. First it uses LSD-SLAM to estimate camera poses in the video, select key frames, and produce\nsemi-dense depth maps. Then 3DFS conducts surface modeling to estimate dense depth maps. Next the depth maps are volumetrically\nfused to create a function field that describes for each voxel the distance to the nearest surface. Because there is a bias in the initial\nfusing, using the estimated camera poses and key frames from LSD-SLAM, we apply the Patch Based Multiview Stereo method which is able\nto generate an accurate sparse point cloud of the surface of object and use that point cloud to refine the function field. Finally\n3DFS conducts a joint segmentation of all the key frames and the voxel map using graph cuts. This gives us both the refined object\nreconstruction and segmentation masks for the object.\n\n\nReconstruction results (SDF + 2D-3D Voxel) compared against other methods\n\nThe reconstructions are pretty good and unlike other methods that are highly choreographed, with highly constrained filming conditions and using complex equipment or targeting easier to models objects to satisfy assumptions, 3DFS can be used by someone with their smartphone in standard\nlighting conditions and is robust to material characteristics like low surface texture, complex shapes, and specular materials.\nThere are some limitations however. The main source of error in the system is the camera pose estimation from LSD SLAM which\neffects both the construction of the depth maps and the accuracy of the PMVS point clouds. This is caused by significant occlusion\nor changes in lighting mid video. There also may be errors due to the handheld nature of the video including out of focus frames.\nAlso though 3DFS does better than other methods when it comes to low surface texture and specularity, the errors from these\nmaterial characteristics still do effect reconstruction. These issues make it harder to model very flat objects for instance.\nThis method is also mostly targeted at small objects and so the choice of using a discreet voxel grid may hamper scalability\nto much larger objects and we also assume that objects are on a flat planar surface so some amount of staging is required by the\nuser. Finally our method still fails to recover small geometric details which is still an open research problem.\nThere are cool applications for this technology. It enables almost anyone to become a 3D modeler without needing to know\nCAD or modeling tools. This could let animators more quickly create 3D assets for films and games. It could be applied\nin the world of augmented reality, letting people quickly move objects into the virtual world. One of most fun applications\nto me is the potential to be able to quickly scan an object with your phone and then 3D print it right then and there,\nan easy way to clone objects in the real world.\n\nYou can read the full paper on 3DFS here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05002.pdf\n\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/3dfs/","title":"3DFS: Deformable Dense Depth Fusion and Segmentation for Object Reconstruction from a Handheld Camera"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/ab-hackathon/":{"body":"In 2016 interestingly enough Anheuser Busch sponsored a hackathon in the ECE Department.

When I was an intern at\nNVIDIA, this wasn't a problem. NVIDIA maintains a massive GPU compute pool which is accessible\nto all its engineers (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-saturnv/). It's harder when\nyou don't work for the company who makes all the GPUs for deep learning, let alone a student. Y\nou can try to use cloud providers like AWS or GCP but that costs money and is not as easy as running\nsomething locally. Having a large on site cluster is nice but you need to make sure that people\nusing the cluster are able to work without interfering with each other.\nACM@UIUC was donated a couple GPUs from NVIDIA for setting up a chapter deep learning cluster.\nWe then built out a machine which had 16 TB of disk space and these two GPUs installed as the first\nnode in our cluster. The question was how to give people access in a way that was contained and controlled.\n\n\nThe Vault, root node of the ACM GPU Cluster\n\nNVIDIA Docker and NGC\nOne of the large investments NVIDIA made in GPU software was adding an integration into docker (https://www.github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker). This\nallows docker containers to access GPUs directly giving people a containerized workspace with GPU compute available.\nThis is a nice way to host many people on one platform and make sure that no one accidentally bricks the system.\nAlong with this docker extension NVIDIA released the NVIDIA GPU Cloud (https://ngc.nvidia.com). NVIDIA GPU Cloud is a\nregistry of docker containers which pre package common deep learning environments and some provisioning software. This lets\nusers who have Deep Learning Workstation Cards, DGX systems or who want to use NVIDIAs Cloud infrastructure to quickly set up\nworkspaces and jobs to train their models. Users can upload a job in the form of a container, the data resources to mount and a\ncommand and then the NGC software will find an open GPU and start the run. Artifacts are then uploaded to the cloud service to be consumed.\n\n\nNVIDIA GPU Cloud, a platform for sharing GPU compute resources amongst a team\n\nBecause NGC is limited to paying customers or owners of $10.000 machines we decided to build a clone which anyone could run.\nJust like NGC it is based off of a repository of docker images and some software to launch containers. Unlike NGC which focused\non batch jobs which makes sense for companies who are training massive networks, we wanted to focus on interactive jobs where people\nare developing code in the system for quick experiments (if they wanted to run a week long job AWS at that point serves them better).\nThe GPU Cluster\n\n\nACM GPU Cluster interface\n\n\n\nPyTorch container environment information\n\nWe run a web server on the root node of the cluster which shows an interface that has a list of different container options for people\nto use. When a user selects one they are promoted to login with their ACM@UIUC credentials which lets us restrict users to just members.\nThen on the system a container is provisioned that is prebaked with the framework of their choice. This container also has a volume mounted\nwhich maps to the host machines 16TB data partition. There we keep peoples long term workspaces, and common datasets like ImageNet or COCO.\nThis lets users restart work easily. Finally an open GPU is assigned to the container for the user. If there are no open GPUs then the user is told to come\nback later. Once the container is provisioned, the web interface directs users to a Jupyter interface which is running within the container.\nHere now users can run and create notebooks in their workspace or they can open up an in-browser bash shell as well.\n\n\nJupyter notebook interface once container has been provisioned\n\nIntegration with the ACM@UIUC infrastructure also allowed us to mediate usage and make sure people don't hog the system.\nThe infra has a credit system which we use to monitor usage, if people run out of credits then jobs cannot be started until they have more.\nThis system was pretty successful, used for hackathon projects, class work and personal projects amongst many members in ACM.\nThe GPU Cluster software is open source software and can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.github.com/acm-uiuc/gpu-cluster\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/acm-gpu-cluster/","title":"ACM@UIUC GPU Cluster"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/amorphous-facade/":{"body":"For 2013 and 2014, I spent a good deal of my free time and all of my summer working on research in Swarm Robotics at the University of Colorado Boulder in Professor Nikolaus Correll's Lab. My main research interest was in exploring ways swarm robotics could be deployed to create new interesting interaction models.\n\n\nConcept art for the Amorphous Facade\n\nMy work centered on a platform developed at Correll Lab called the Amorphous Facade; a concept for a modular smart wall where the \"operating system\" of the wall was completely decentralized and leveraged ad-hoc self-organization to do useful work. The idea is that you could build spaces out of the blocks were the intellegent features of the wall allowed you to manage enviormental conditions like lighting, HVAC, privacy and sound and also serve as display and control surface. Each block in the wall is embedded with a ATmega microcontroller, a sensor array, power systems, communication and LEDs. Each block was made out of acrylic, with an aluminum border which is sensitive to touch and a variable transparency faceplate which goes from opaque to clear when a voltage is applied.\n\n\nThree blocks stacked, pins on the sides of the blocks facilitate power distribution and communication between blocks\n\nThe system becomes interesting because though the core functionality and software of the RTOS is identical from block to block, the blocks can have heterogenous hardware. So one block may be a camera block, another block may be use for HVAC or another could be for sound. Because of the networked nature of the system, capabilities can be shared and combined, for instance a single microphone block and a set of speaker blocks could be combined to create a loud speaker.\nBecause the system is required to be reconfigurable, the question of a decentralized user interface becomes important. Touch is a natural interaction medium for a wall. However, since the configuration of blocks could entirely different from one setup to another, in order to establish a usable touch wall, touches must be able to be put in context (i.e. we need to know where on the wall a touch was detected). We therefore need a way when the system starts up for blocks to establish their location relative to other blocks.\nInitialization of the Wall\nWithout localization, touch or any sort of multi-node display or action is impossible. The approach we used leverages the fact that each block is the same dimensions and that each block is created with a unique identifier. We designate a block the origin node (though in the implementation in the paper this is hard coded, a simple leader election algorithm would suffice to define the origin node of the network). The origin node first calculates the coordinates of its borders (where the touch sensors are). Then the origin node multicasts to the bordering blocks the calculated center of the border blocks in relation to its center. Each of these border nodes then does the same process, propagating localization through the network. The location setting message also includes a hop count so blocks will localized based on the message with the lowest hop count.\n\n\nBlocks mid localization, different colors represent different states in the localization process.\n\nNow that each block knows where it is in relation to others, it is now possible to start creating more interesting interfaces to leverage the features of the wall.\nGesture Based Distributed User Interaction System for a Reconfigurable Self-Organizing Smart Wall\n\nSee paper for full details: Gesture Based Distributed User Interaction System for a Reconfigurable Self-Organizing Smart Wall\n\nAt the time of the paper, there were a lot of potential functions that the wall could implement based on the sensors embedded in the control board. The wall can change transparency, it can act as a lighting system, a sound system, an HVAC system and a display.\nAll of these systems require user controls that are intuitive but also possible to be implemented within the network. The simplest technical solution is to have each block expose itself as the interface for the wall, using the six touch buttons as the input mechanism. The issue with this is that its is hard to convey useful information on a single block that can has no display.\nA better solution is a multi-node system where a subset of the wall work together to expose a more useful interface.\nEstablishing a Multi-node Interface\nSince the system is distributed and there is no hierarchy in the system, the blocks must self organize to create the interface. The way we do this is when a user touches on of the blocks on the wall in an effort to accomplish a task, the block that was touched recruits the surrounding nodes to create a flower like menu system. At the time of the paper the menu functions are represented as colors, however when displays are integrated into the face of the block, the menu becomes more descriptive.\n\n\nAn example of the flower menu open, each color represents a different function for the wall.\n\nA user can then select a function by sliding a block color into the center.\nWe then describe a set of interaction models to address various tasks.\nInteraction Models\nBinary Settings\nFor binary settings (ON / OFF) we show a switch like interface where swiping from the bottom to the top or the top to the bottom flips the switch.\n\n\nAn interaction where flipping the binary switch makes the wall transparent instead of opaque\n\nA more intuitive interaction maybe to make a similar looking interface but in order to reflect device state, the current state is illuminated and the opposite state should be white. Then the user should just have to touch the block representing the state desired\nGranular Settings\nFor settings that have more granular controls than on or off, we describe a dial interface. The user swipes around the center block in a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion in order to increase or decrease the setting value.\n\n\nAn interaction where swiping around the dial increases the volume of the speaker\n\n\n\nNicholas Farrow, Prof. Correll and I presenting our work at TEI 2014 in Munich\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/amorphous-facade/","title":"The Amorphous Facade and Developing a Gesture Based Decentralized User Interface"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/arbor/":{"body":"The impetus to create such a framework stems from the reality that the majority of developers who work in our development group, will not be there in 4 years (and most will leave earlier). We also see new developers walk in oblivious of the frameworks we have used in the past. Just in the past four years, Rails has been supplanted by Node.js and Angular/React, and PHP has gone from a “goto” language to an outdated language with only a few purposes.\nThis poses a few issues to these high churn development groups when considering choices for technology stacks in the context of maintainability and future-proofing. Pragmatically, original authors of a project for a student club, for example, will not be in school for more than a few years to maintain the project, and the newcomers will not know how to sustain the technology stack of the project created just a couple years ago.\nSustainable Infrastructure\nMotivation\nACM@UIUC is a student-run organization that looks to [….]. We maintain a significant amount of infrastructure for a organization of our size […].  However as we are associated with a university, the members of the organization change every year as students graduate and new ones take their place. In the past our infrastructure was based on a large monolithic codebase which manages all of the member services we have (e.g….). While monolithic architectures have their benefits such as clear model ownership (a-write-once-use-everywhere mentality) making it easy for an up to speed team to make incremental improvements, the inherent difficultly in understanding a highly interconnected system coupled with the high churn rate in maintainers made it challenging to maintain such a project and it means that development efforts were a mad push to get to stable and then hope nothing breaks because no one will try to fix it after a couple years.\nMicroservices\nOur response to this problem was to adopt the aforementioned microservice architecture, which looks to promote modularity and minimization of external dependencies. The main proponents of this architecture include large scale companies like Netflix and many startups. The system breaks down into two groups: clients and services. All components of the infrastructure are completely separate applications running on separate processes in deployment. To prevent client (and service) developers to manage an ever-increasing list of services and their APIs, many implementations of the microservice architectures include what is referred to as an API Gateway. This gateway exposes all the services as a unified RESTful API while managing application level security, inter-service communication, and routing of requests. This approach provides several key benefits:\n\n\nServices are inherently simple. Application scale ranges from a standard 1000-line Sinatra app with multiple database models to a 100-line Node app which simply reads and writes to a YAML file.\n\n\nAny service can be discarded and replaced without affecting other services (provided functionality parity).\n\n\nThird party APIs are easily and securely accessible by any client that can access the API Gateway. This moves the burden off the client developer to juggle tokens.\n\n\nClients are far simpler because the application logic has been abstracted behind the gateway.\n\n\nMaintainers can focus and own their own codebase.\n\n\nAPI Gateway\nThe key to the  microservice architecture is the API gateway. There are many platforms which provide the functionality of an API gateway; Amazon Web Services, Nginx, and others have offerings that manage access to services and coordinate micro-service systems. There also exists a few frameworks to self-host an API Gateway. We will examine in detail Tyk and Kong, two popular options, however, there are others that are language or web framework specific.\nTyk\nTyk is a full-featured gateway that looks centralized much of the common tasks that exist within common infrastructure setups. It does things like having a centralized Authentication provided in the gateway, allows for granular access control to routes and hosts API documentation. It configures its system using a series of JSON objects either held in a database or in a series of files that are parsed and include many options controlling the massive feature set Tyk offers.\nKong\nKong also has a vast set of features and plugins, as also looks to centralize much of the common tasks in managing the infrastructure\nKong, however, takes a different approach to its proxy. It only takes a hostname in and relies on the client to provide the host it’s looking for (it does allow for a host proxy though the documentation is not clear as to how that works exactly). Since everything is done through DNS listings, it is very easy to add your service, but it means that it’s hard to come in and see what is going on without the use of its admin API\nThere are many other platforms that include gateway functionality, in addition to other features, such as Docker Compose. However, all these systems are high performance, complex pieces of software that are meant to serve millions of users at once, which is a bit heavy handed for nonindustrial use. Additionally, the use of these systems may require platform buy-in, suffer from lack of ease-of-use and clarity and perhaps require the user to spend money to set up a gateway.\nArbor\nWe were not happy with the current offerings for API Gateways as many were just too complex to maintain in our organization (again churn being a big factor here). We, therefore, created our own API Gateway framework which we call Arbor.\nArbor is a statically configured API Gateway framework written in Go. It provides the key gateway services, having a full-featured REST proxy all behind its hostname, with websockets and more modern protocols in the pipeline, it manages application level security and simple request sanitization, it also features a human readable service definition format.\nArbor is broken into four sub-packages, server, proxy, services, and security. The full system architecture is described in Figure 1. and is centralized around the Arbor server. The server manages the execution of the subsystems within Arbor.\nThe first layer on the server is the router. As of now, the router is vanilla gorilla/mux but we fully expect to need to modify the router to support future development.\nRoute definitions are user defined through two types defined by Arbor/services, Routes and RouteCollections, in which Routes define a specific route, and RouteCollections encompass a service’s routes. As part of the service definition, the user specifies the proxy handler that would manage the communication between the client and the service from the set of functions in the proxy package.\nAt runtime these service definitions are loaded into the router and as a request comes in the router hands the request to the appropriate proxy handler.\nBefore any further processing, if the user enables security features, the next step for the request is to go through two main security features. First is a client authorization verification step. When security features are enabled the gateway requires clients to provide a token generated by the security package. If this is not provided the request is denied at the gateway level. Any successful access is logged in a access log file and then the request is moved on to the second step. We wanted to take the burden off our service and client developers to do proper html sanitization, so we have a module in the pipeline to clean the request. Services are still required to do some validation but we are looking to centralize common tasks.\nAfterwards, the request is sent to the proxy server, which will inject any required access keys or extra data in order to fulfil a request. This allows clients to avoid needing to manage a huge set of tokens and keys. The request goes out from the proxy server and then the response is forwarded back to the client.\n\nThis means that registering a new service is just adding a file, recompiling and deploying, and authorizing a client is a just simple command as of now. The question of what data is available is answered by the definition itself.\nArbor attempts to be simple, making very few assumptions, and is easily extensible.\nThis new framework and architecture choice has accelerated the creation of new pieces infrastructure in our organization many times over. It has given us the freedom to replace many aging systems with new modern ones without fear of breaking other things. It also gives the developers the leeway to focus more on functionality over sustainability, since it is now expected their code will last perhaps two or three years max. Each service can now range from 100 lines of code to 1000. Our infrastructure is now language agnostic as well. We have a ruby, a python and a javascript developer all developing code for the same system. It is also easier now to replace a system since a spec of what needs to be supported is kept in the schema file for that service. We now have 15 services and two clients all managed through Arbor serving 1000 people.\nFuture Work\nThroughout Arbor’s development, we have uncovered a few issues which should be identified and addressed:\n\n\nArbor currently only supports RESTful APIs, we are looking to add support for websockets so that the final parts of our infrastructure can come under the gateway umbrella.\n\n\nDocumentation generation from parsing schema files would be a welcomed feature so unaffiliated consumers of our API will have documentation other than our repo\n\n\nImproved centralized functionality for things like security is being considered. Currently, there is a simple sanitizer in the proxy pipeline that can be enabled. We have this so that service developers do not need to consider security other than that which is specific to their service. This sanitizer is not very powerful at this point and we must also balance the urge to centralize functionality with not making assumptions about development processes.\n\n\nWe do not expect Arbor to be serving millions; we see it as a Sinatra/Flask to Kong or AWS’s Rails /Django, but we think that this framework will let a whole new set of developers experiment with microservices. It looks to provide the barebones API Gateway functionality and let the developer focus on the application functionality. Ultimately for us, it means we no longer have to race against time to train developers before the lead maintainers leave and that the infrastructure of our organization can now better reflect the needs of its members. We are now more open to one-off contributors, who wish to add one service and leave. When the next web framework of choice emerges, we will have a system ready to accept it with minimal wrestling\nThe source code is released under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License and on Github\n\nCheck it out at https://github.com/acm-uiuc/arbor\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/arbor/","title":"Arbor - Designing To Be Replaced"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/chatgpt-web/":{"body":"Sections 1 and 2 are motivation and background if you care, Section 3 is the real meat of the essay.\nChatGPT is more Information Retrieval UI than Artificial Intelligence\n\n(In the AGI sense)\n\nGenerative AI is having its moment right now and OpenAI's ChatGPT is at the center of it. The \"humanness\" of the conversations one has with these chatbots have many pundits busy wondering if this is the dawn of the end of humanity or a break down in the economy is imminent. Meanwhile, many in the research community have pointed out the fundamentally iterative improvements in underlying ML technology behind the system and are hesitant to ascribe too much to these systems (yet). Personally, I lean towards the iterative improvement camp when viewing these systems in the artificial intelligence context.\nHowever, I believe (and many others have pointed this out in one way or another) that the fundamental contribution of systems like ChatGPT is a step-change difference in the performance and particularly the usability of information retrieval systems. Chatbot systems based on LLMs bring us as close as we have come to the realization of science fiction inspired technology where a user can converse with a system using natural language to parse, extract and manipulate information. Examples like code being written on the fly, articles being summarized and essays being generated, can be thought of as a form of artificial intelligence but I argue that they should be more thought of as an alternative to existing information synthesis workflows.\nAbstractly, lots of knowledge work: programming, research, writing, art, can be thought of as a loop of searching a knowledge base, evaluating results, identifying the key ideas, synthesizing new ones and repeating. The primary difficulty is the searching step. 70 years ago, this required going to physical repositories of information like libraries, museums, reading a lot of books and papers, listening to talks, performances etc. 40 years ago, people started making queryable and traversable repositories (e.g. hypertext and the \"World Wide Web\") and until yesterday tools like Google would be used to search through them, finding relevant information / inspiration. Today and tomorrow it seems more and more likely that this role (and part of the synthesis role as well – a topic for another essay) will be replaced by systems like ChatGPT.\nChatbots are a Better UI For Information Retrieval\nSystems like ChatGPT wrap up the open web in a neat box. You can \"speak\" directly to them, you don't need to reformat your question into a pseudo-natural query language that many of us have learned to speak fluently. And, because it understands context, it is easy to refine your questions to tune the results. Language models both encode a compressed knowledge base (provided by training on the open web) and have the capability to leverage other knowledge bases to provide results. Of course, due to the nature of language models the issue of \"hallucination\" is an issue but any competent and principled knowledge worker can easily check the results and refine if necessary. Information retrieval is hard to do but easy to verify. To this end, these systems seem like a wonderful step forward in the accessibility of using the web.\nUser Interfaces, I'd argue, are one if of not the most important factor for technology adoption at any level. I cannot be convinced that computers would be as prevalent a tool as they are without the Graphical User Interface and more recently Multi-Touch. Anyone who has used a command line can explain the cognitive load required to operate a system at that level. There is for sure more control at a lower level, but it requires users to have a strong mental model of the state of the system. GUIs require very little of that. Adoption of the web itself has been mediated by UI step changes as well, first the Graphical Web Browser, then Search Engines. Systems like ChatGPT are the next step in that lineage for the web and just like how GUIs abstract much of the operating system from the user, ChatGPT can abstract much of the web.\nPrevious versions of the web in a box have failed precisely because the UIs were not capable enough. Voice assistants like Alexa, Ok Google, Siri and Duplex struggle firstly because voice is likely not the ideal modality for these sort of UIs, speech varies in so many ways e.g. timbre, accents, background noise. Language models solve this by using text. Text is uniform, discrete, there are fewer sources of confusion. Second voice assistants \"don't work\"; it is a frustrating experience trying to get one of these things to do anything of slight complexity correctly. Even if the assistant heard you correctly, it does not understand what to do or how to do it. Without explicit developer integrations, voice assistants are next to useless. Critically, language models have proven their ability to provide meaningful and interesting results on their own without external resources and more importantly, also have been shown to have the ability to traverse the web to find new information. LM-based chatbots provide a smooth onramp from the open HTML web to the chatbot world. Much like how Facebook created a MySpace bridge to make it easier to switch, LM-based chatbots do not need to wait for developers to integrate with them to be useful.\n\"OpenAI\" vs. the Open Web\nThe recent announcement of \"plugins\" for ChatGPT has me concerned. Not about any sort of existential risk due to runaway AGI in the near to mid-term, but about the prospects for the open web as we know it. In the past 30 years the \"World Wide Web\" has become the near complete repository of human knowledge and it is the reason why systems like ChatGPT even have a chance to exist. But some of its most valuable qualities are not foundational to its job as a knowledge base, namely the fact it is human readable/browsable, open and (provided you are connected) equally accessible to all. Some corners of the knowledge base may be more curated, organized and searchable than others (e.g. Wikipedia, StackOverflow, Reddit) and some parsing and retrieval tools may be better than others (e.g. Google - until 3-5 years ago) but whenever anyone anywhere in the world opens a web browser, they for the most part have the same access as anyone else to any part of the knowledge base.\nThe fact that it feels like LM-based chatbots are the next step in interacting with the internet creates a forcing function to be a first class member in that world and plugins seem like it will be the mechanism to do so. Will people find you or your service if you're not integrated into ChatGPT? Google already has been criticized for centralizing and arbitrating traffic on the web and many actors have taken to optimizing their content to best fit Google. The implications of this new UI takes that world a step further. Ultimately, what backstopped Google's information was human readable, openly accessible content. Google fundamentally prefers HTML, the interconnections between HTML pages serve at the foundation of its approach to extracting knowledge. Therefore, to an extent Google encourages the open human readable web (perhaps not in its ideal form) and as a sideffect there remains the ability to push through or go around Google and still get to some sort of readable content. Language models (especially hosted ones) themselves are absolutely not human readable, and with plugins the need for an open human-readable raw corpus becomes optional once people have transitioned to using LM-based systems. Even additional training data can be captured monitoring human input and by querying plugins, things OpenAI can include as conditions of being part of their ecosystem. Content can more easily be centralized in privately maintained, heavily accessed controlled repositories and mediated through primarily web APIs with no requirement for an open readable option.\nIf this is indeed what happens, what happens to the large corpus of human readable and browsable content? Will it just atrophy over time? What happens when not just information retrieval but information insertion into the knowledge base is moderated through systems like ChatGPT? Society already has an incredibly strained relationship with content middlemen, e.g. Google, Meta, Twitter. It is not clear what these actors' responsibilities are, or if they should have these responsibilities in the first place. The move to Chatbot UIs pushes us even more towards companies mediating discourse and access to knowledge in society. This raises the questions: how does ChatGPT (really how does OpenAI) decide who gets to service your question and what information gets added to knowledge bases, how does OpenAI get compensated for this middle man service and what incentives does that produce? It feels incredibly uncomfortable that we seem to be careening towards an uncertain future without considering the values we might be leaving behind.\nTo get an idea of what some potential futures may be look to existing integrated platforms and previous iterations of recommender systems. For example, how applications integrate into WeChat. WeChat mediates the interface and access users have to applications and applications to users. This middle man position provides a convenient gateway for censorship. We can see shades of this already in systems like Bing AI. Look at how YouTube creators try to divine the whims of the \"YouTube Algorithm\" and more importantly look at all the content left by the wayside, inaccessible to anyone because YouTube decided its not \"relevant\". Also look at social media in general. Social media platforms - Facebook, Instagram, etc. have over the last decade pulled the individual off the open web. Where as in the late 90s and early 00s, it may be common to see people maintaining a website for themselves or a perhaps a business or hobby, these sites for the most part have been subsumed by simply an Instagram page. For many these accounts are their sole personal presence on the web. Behind these walled gardens owners mediate what you and others can see, how you see it, what is permissable and what the incentives of the platform are. Access to the information in these closed parts of the web are set via negotiations between large actors or by signing an opaque end user license.\nWithout the UI of the web continuing to incentivize HTML, one could imagine this format going the way of books, mostly replaced by databases hooked up to Chatbots where users can retrieve information, do key actions and insert new information to improve the knowledge base without needing to find, read, then create or edit a website. For knowledge work perhaps this looks like hooking up an S3 bucket to ChatGPT, asking it to browse the information, extract some key information, and help you compose a new document which is stored in the bucket. For the individual currently using closed social media apps, perhaps in the future you would ask ChatGPT \"What are my friends up to?\" or to post a status update. Both for generic knowledge work and many of the common things individuals do on the web, this feels like it will be an easier information synthesis workflow than the current paradigm. However, it sacrifices a lot of the benefits that the open web brought with it, like those discussed above namely being decentralized, open and human traversable and readable. Unfortunately, as we have seen time and time again, people will sacrifice a lot for better user experiences.\nThere is this notion of an approaching fissure in the web splitting it into a web for robots and a web for humans. Many discussions of this idea focus on the ability to tell real from fake, generated from handcrafted. But I do not think this discourse focuses enough on the notions of control and freedom. How will the web change when its UI changes so fundamentally? What formats do we incentivize and what values do those formats encode? Who manages and owns the web when its UI is chatbots and what are the incentives of actors? Where do individuals fit in? Is there still space for an open, readable web? And most crucially: What are we giving up when this change happens? Recommendation systems which in many ways are the precursors to chatbots have been blamed for everything from increasing depression to inciting atrocities. We would be fools to blindly make this transition without thinking through what we would like the future to look like, and what values we would like to preserve.\nThe worst case scenario is extreme but I think the likelihood of significant negative externalities relating to information access, mediation and the health of the human readable web from a transition to LM-Based IR systems is non-zero (and much larger than the likelihood of malicious AGI in the coming years). It took 30 years for the open web to take the form it has today and it seems like there is no guarantee now that it will continue on the trajectory it has been on. For the first time in a long time, the human readable web has real competition and I do not think it is clear who is going to win.\n\nThis essay was handwritten without the aid of large language models\n\n\nUpdate 3/26/23:\nI thought this thread speaks well to of some the ideas presented here: https://twitter.com/peternixey/status/1640002493630369792\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/chatgpt-web/","title":"ChatGPT's Plugin System Poses an Existential Risk to the Open Web"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/cs196/":{"body":"Something unique about UIUC is that they let a bunch of undergrads try to and teach a course in the form of the CS Department's Freshman Projects Course.\nThey took this course as an oppurtunity for undergrads to decide what they thought was important to learn when you are an ambitious student just\nentering college and want to get up to speed quickly. Everyone has heard the complaints about how a course is outdated or teaching technology that\nyou will never use but this was an oppurtunity to change that.\nWe decided that the format would be one that tries to replicate the working enviorment you might experience at a job or your first internship, hopefully\ngiving a people a leg up that coming summer. We also wanted to instill in the students at UIUC a culture of making, that people should take their\ncreativity and realize it into something instead of like other classes being given a brief and a set of steps and then executing.\nThe class had two halves, the lecture half and the project half. We took lectures as an oppurtunity to expose freshmen to all the interesting things\nyou might want to know about just starting out in CS. We had lectures on VR, Machine Learning, new programming languages like Rust, how to be\na better developer using tooling like Git, Emacs, and Bash and how to approach interviewing for jobs and interships. It was an hour a week\nwhere upper classmen can impart some knowledge to new students. The project half was the main meat of the course. Students at the beginning of the\nsemester would needed to come up with a topic and pitch it to the rest of the class. Students then selected what they wanted to work on and were assigned an upperclassman \"Project Manager\" who has a background in that topic and through out the semester students will\nrun that project in an agile fashion with weekly scrums, a kanban board and the PM helping students break down the tasks needed to complete the project.\nThe course was pretty successful. There were a ton of fantastic projects people made. Students who finished the class wanted to comeback as PMs to go through the experience again. Lot's of people said their 196 project, the process of going through agile development, the prep for interviews and the advice they got from their mentors helped them get their first internships. For the upperclassmen it was a great experience too, it gave them a shot to try out project managment and learn how to lead a team.\nAnd for the department they saw a lot of the things we did in CS196 and took it as inspiration to update parts of the CS curriculum, reordering the class progression\nand adding a new class for 1st and 2nd year students teaching software engineering practices using the same ideas in 196 (we actually collaborated on the design of that course).\nThe course was our sort of playground as well to try out new pedagogies. We actually hosted a full fledged conference featuring Professors presenting their research\nand insight about CS to the students. We hosted hackathons to give students large blocks of time to work with their teams and PMs. We sort of got to create the class we wanted to take when we came to UIUC for the first time.\n\nHere is a sample lecture:\n\n\n\nCS 196 Website: http://cs196.cs.illinois.edu/\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/cs196/","title":"Developing the Course Work for UIUC's CS196"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/digits-of-e/":{"body":"\nTranscription of my IB Math HL Paper from 2013\n\nGoogle being a leading company in the technology industry in order to remain competitive needs to find the best talent in computer science, mathematics and the hard sciences. However pure recruitment does not always find the best and the brightest. In an effort to attract driven and curious people to work for Google, the company released this billboard ad.\n\nPersonally, this problem is of interests as it is an seemingly simple computer science problem, yet it is used by a company with high standards to screen talent. Therefore it is a good problem to measure ones skills. Though it seems simple, with closer inspection, this problem begins to examine not only a mathematical curiosity but with a little pursuit of elegance also examines number theory, the frequency of primes within a set of digits and efficiency of algorithms. Computer science itself is an interesting extension of a variety of fields including mathematics and engineering. Computer science has enabled mathematics, scientists, engineers and even high school students to explore the curiosities and patterns of mathematics and science and to create new things. Algorithms in computer science start to become very similar to fields in mathematics like combinatorics, probability and number theory. While looking at algorithms, it is interesting to see where the two fields overlap. For instance, for loops and recursive methods in many programming languages are comparable to summations and factorials.\npublic static int factorial(int num) {\n    if (num == 0) {\n        return 1;\n    } else {\n        //recursive (calls itself again)\n        num * factorial((num -  1));\n    }\n    return temp;\n}\n\nAt first glance, a brute force method of checking if each ten digit number $i$ is divisible by any of the numbers from $2$ to $x - 1$ should not take that long. However, It is unclear though how far into the digits of $e$ the program would have to go. Eventhough it may take one iteration 10 seconds, 100 iterations could take 10000 and so on. Therefore a more feasible approach to this problem may be in order.\nDiscussion of the Problem In-depth\nFrom a high level this problem has two parts. Part one is to develop a sufficiently precise definition of $e$ to test for the prime in question. The odds are extremely low that the answer would occur in the standard definition of $e$ of most programming languages. Part two is to develop a algorithm that will test numbers for primarily since a brute force method is not scalable.\n$e$ as it is defined in Java’s java.lang.Math class is $2.718281828459045$. Java is a object oriented programming language that is meant to be compatible across different computers.The decision to use Java will be explained later In the majority of computer science problems, this definition is sufficient, however as this problem is to find the first ten digit prime, in this definitions there are six ten digit possible numbers to test. The likelihood that the prime exists in these digits are fairly low and therefore it would be useful to generate a more precise definition. $e$ can be calculated in a variety of ways, the first of which would be the method used by Bernoulli:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (1 + \\frac{1}{n})^n$$\nThis is a method that is really easy to understand and is therefore the first definition of $e$ many students learn, yet is not very practical in a computational sense as limits are not very easily implemented. Others issues like the lack of control of the precision of the number since the number’s precision does not change linearly. It is therefore hard to predict a point at which the number is sufficiently large and the program can terminate.\n\nFinally, the third method and the one chosen was the Taylor series definition of $e$:\n$$e = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!}$$\nThe Taylor series definition is easy to understand and the most elegant to implement as it is simply a while loop continually adding the next element to the sum of the previous ones. An implementation is below:\npublic static double e_taylor_series() {\n    double temp = 1;\n    int iteration = 1;\n    while(1 == 1) {\n        temp = temp + (1/factorial(iteration))\n        //see factorial function above\n        iteration++;\n    }\n    return temp;\n}\n\nOf course this method would create and infinite loop, but it would calculate the true value of $e$. Simply changing the while loop to a for loop and selecting a number of iterations allows the program to be terminated at the desired level of precision:\npublic static double e_taylor_series() {\n    double temp = 1;\n    for(int i = 1; i &lt;= 500; i++) {\n        temp = temp + (1/factorial(i))\n        //see factorial function above\n    }\n    return temp;\n}\n\nHowever a new issue arises that has not to do with mathematics but with computer science. The primitive double which is used by computers to store large decimals as defined by IEEE is a primitive with 52 bits available for fraction storage and 11 bits for exponents. This means that the smallest number that can stored in a double $4.94065645841246544e-324$ with 18 digits of significant figures. If $e$ was calculated using a double primitive the program could only test 7 possible values which does not improve the test set very much over the language’s definition. This is where the choice of the correct programming language can make the program very simple or very complicated. The run time of the program is very important since the precise location of the first prime is not yet known. If this program is to be scalable the runtime should not require hours. Using a language like C which is an extremely low level language will increase speed significantly since C is run without very many peripheral activities, but a solution in C because of the lack of data types other than the standard float and double for decimals would require parsing decimals into large integer arrays and adding those together in the right locations which is very difficult to implement without errors and a large amount of time committed to debugging. Meanwhile, a higher level language like Java may be slightly slower since all of its commands are run through essentially another computer called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which increases compatibility (also a positive for writing scalable code). However, defined in the java.lang library is a class bigDecimal that allows for more digits to be stored solving this issue easily. The algorithm for $e$ is as follows:\npublic static BigDecimal calc_e() {\n    BigDecimal e = BigDecimal.ONE;\n    //the definition of e, big decimal object is required to hold the value\n    BigDecimal factorial = BigDecimal.ONE;\n    //factorial object, must be the same type as e to be able to use the big decimal\n    // methods add and divide\n    for(int i = 1; i &lt; 500; i++) {\n        //summation of the taylor series definition of e for the first 500 iterations /\n        // 1/1+1/1+1/2....+1/499+1/500\n        factorial = factorial.multiply(new BigDecimal(i * 1.0 + \"\"));\n        e = e.add(new BigDecimal(1.0 + “”).divide(factorial, new MathContext(10000)));\n    }\n    /* String eString = (e + \"\");\n       supposed to print out e, computing resources run out of memory\n       long eDef = Long.parseLong(eString);\n       System.out.println(\"e = \" +eDef); */\n    return e;\n}\n\nNow that a sufficiently precise value of $e$ has be generated, it is now necessary to develop a way to test numbers for their primality. A computer could easily given sufficient time test for a number $n$ every number from $2$ to $n - 1$ for divisibility. A slightly more efficient method would be to check each number from $2$ to $\\sqrt{n}$ as shown below:\npublic static boolean isPrime (long n) {\n    if (n &lt;= 1){\n        //if the number is less than 1 it cannot be prime\n        return false;\n    }\n    if (n % 2 == 0) {\n         //if the number is divisable by 2 then is cannot be prime\n        return false;\n    }\n    long m = (long) Math.sqrt(n);\n    //there is no need to test past the square root of a number\n    //since the square root is always a divisor of a number\n    for (long i = 3; i &lt;= m; i += 2) {\n        //tests every number from three to the square root of n\n        if (n % i == 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n\nHowever, this is not scalable. A successful program should be able to find the first 20 digit or 40 digit prime number, (provided enough memory) in a reasonable time. Therefore, it is necessary to examine some other methods of determining primality of a number. A method that is quite popular is Wilson’s Theorem. Wilson’s Theorem states that:\n$$ (n - 1) \\equiv - 1 \\ (mod \\ n) $$\nor that a number $n$ is prime if and only if the factorial of $(n - 1)$ is exactly 1 less that a multiple of $n$. This is an extremely powerful statement and one that is extremely easy to implement in code.\npublic static boolean prime(int n) {\n    int test = factorial(n-1) + 1;\n    //Calculate the test number\n    if (test % n == 0) {\n        // check divisibility\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\nWilson’s Theorem is very easy to prove and is as follows:\nProof of Wilson’s Theorem\nThe when $p = 2, 3$ the result is obvious, therefore $p$ is an odd prime, $p &gt; 3$. If $p$ is a composite number then its divisors are in the set ${1,2,3,..., p - 1}$ and $((p - 1)!, p) &gt; 1$, therefore $(p - 1)! = -1 \\ (mod \\ p)$ for a composite number. If $p$ is prime, then each integers in the set relatively prime to $p$. Each of these integers a there is another $b$ such that $ab = 1 \\ (mod \\ p)$. It is important to note that this b is unique modulo $p$, and that since $p$ is prime, $a = b$ if and only if $a$ is $1$ or $p - 1$. Now if we omit $1$ and $p - 1$, then the others can be grouped into pairs whose product is one showing\n$$ 2 * 3 * 4 * \\ ... * \\ (p-2) = 1 \\ (mod \\ p) $$\nor\n$$ (p - 2)! = 1 \\ (mod \\ p) $$\nThis equation multiplied by $(p - 1)$ proves the theorem.\nThough the implementation of the theorem was quite simple, an issue that arises is that the theorem requires factorials and the factorial of a ten digit number let a 30 or 50 digit one requires some serious computational power and this program should not depend on access to a supercomputer to successfully run.\nThere is a a similar theorem to Wilson’s Theorem called Fermat’s Little Theorem.\n$$ a^{(p -1)} \\equiv 1 \\ (mod \\ p) \\ s.t. \\ (a,p) = 1$$\nFermat’s Little Theorem states that for a prime number $p$ and any number $a$ where the greatest common divisor is $1$ that a to the power of $p - 1$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $p$.\nA corollary to this theorem is\n$$a^p \\equiv a \\ (mod \\ p)$$\nwhere a is any number and $p`$ is a prime. The proof of this theorem is as follows:\nProof of the Fermat’s Little Theorem\nProof By Induction\nP0. $0^p \\equiv 0 \\ (mod \\ p)$ is true for all integers\nLemma\nFor any prime $p$, $(x + y)^p = x^P + y^p$ or $(x + y)^p \\equiv x^P + y^p \\ (mod \\ p)$ for any $x$ and $y$ in the finite field $GF(p)$\nTo be proved later.\nP1. Assume $kp \\equiv k \\ (mod \\ p)$, and consider $p(k + 1)$\nUsing the lemma $(k + 1)^p \\equiv k^p + 1^p \\ (mod \\ p)$\nBy the assumption, $kp \\equiv k \\ (mod \\ p)$ -&gt; $1p = 1$. Thus $(k + 1)^p \\equiv k^p + 1 \\ (mod \\ p)$\nProof of Lemma\nUsing binomial theorem, the binomial coefficients are all integers and when $0 &lt; i &lt; p$, neither of the terms in the denominator includes a factor of $p$, leaving the coefficient itself to possess a prime factor of $p$ which must exist in the numerator, implying that $\\binom{p}{i} \\equiv 0 \\ (mod \\ p), \\ 0 &lt; i &lt; p$\nModulo $p$, this eliminates all but the first and last terms of the sum on the right-hand side of the binomial theorem for prime p. ∎\nThe primality of p is essential to the lemma; otherwise, we have examples like $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ which is not divisible by 4.\nFermat’s Little Theorem also has a simple implementation. By using 2 for a the resources necessary for the program are minimized. note. an extra library is required: java.lang.math.\n    public static boolean prime(int n) {\n    int test = Math.pow(2,n) - 2;\n    //Calculate the test number\n    if (test % n == 0) {\n        // check divisibility\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\nThis solution would be quite elegant if it were not for one caveat of Fermat’s Little Theorem. Fermat’s Little Theorem in addition to revealing primes reveals pseudoprimes or composite numbers that have a quality that primes have, namely fulfilling v. Though specific bases have specific pseudoprimes, a pseudoprime that is a pseudoprime for all values of base a is called a Carmichael number. Carmichael numbers are the set of all numbers that fulfill the following equation.\n$$({\\sum_{a=1}^{p-1} a^{p-1}}, p) = 1 $$\nMeaning the greatest common divisor of the summation from $a$ to $p - 1$ of $a^{p-1}$ and $p$ is 1.\nWhile it would be easy to check for Carmichael numbers in the code, it would be difficult to check for all the other pseudoprimes not confined to the set of Carmichael numbers.\nA more robust form of Fermat’s Little Theorem called the Lucas Primality Test is probably the most scalable version of a primality test. The test states:\n$$a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\ (mod \\ n)$$\n$$a^{(n-1)/q} \\not\\equiv 1 \\ (mod \\ n)$$\nIf both of the above statements are true, where $q$ is each prime factor of $(n-1)$, the number is prime. This test gets rid of the false positives of Fermat’s little theorem of making it not necessity to include a test for Carmichael numbers and running the risk of getting a pseudoprime returned and could be implemented to check the output. The code implementation of the Lucas primality test is below.\npublic class prime {\n    public static boolean prime(int n) {\n        int test = Math.pow(2, (n - 1)) - 1;\n        //Calculate the test number\n        if (test % n == 0){\n            // check divisibility (for find_prime_factors() see below)\n            int[] prime_factors = find_prime_factors(n);\n            for(int i = 0; i &lt;= 40; i++ ) {\n                if(prime_factors[i] != 0) {\n                    //make sure not to divide by zero\n                    int carmichael =  Math.pow(2,((n-1)/\n                    prime_factors[i])) - 1;\n                    if(carmichael % n == 0){\n                        return false;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            return true;\n        } else  {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static int[] find_prime_factors(int n) {\n        int[] factors = new int[40];\n        int x = 0;\n        //  #2 that divide n\n        while (n % 2 == 0) {\n            factors[x] = 2;\n            x++;\n            n = n / 2;\n        }\n        // n is odd a. can skip one test (Note i = i +2)\n        for (int i = 3; i &lt;= Math.sqrt(n); i = i + 2) {\n            // While i divides n, print i and divide n\n            while (n % i == 0) {\n                factors[x] = i;\n                x++;\n                n = n / i;\n            }\n        }\n        // final prime\n        if (n &gt; 2) {\n            factors[x] = n;\n        }\n            return factors;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSolution\nWith Lucas’s Primality Test all of the algorithms should be designed to find the first ten digit prime number in the digits of e. First a Taylor series will calculate a value of $e$ through 500 iterations of the series. Then using the Lucas Primality Test each ten consecutive digits will be sampled to test for primality. It is hard to tell if the arbitrary settings of 500 iterations and 40 prime factors will be sufficient to complete the program but since those are easily changeable, that is not a significant issue.\nThere will be two programs included in this paper, one use the brute force method and the other the Lucas Test to test numbers for primality, both are included in Appendix A. This will check the answers against each other. Both programs work by calculating a value for $e$ and storing it in a bigDecimal object. This is then parsed into a String removing the first 2 and the decimal point for simplicity. Afterwards 10 character chunks are casted into a single integer and tested through the two prime tests. If the number is prime, the system prints it out with the number prime it is in the set and the digit after the decimal point at which the first digit appears.\nAfter running through the two programs I found that the first prime in the digits of $e$ is 7427466391 starting at digit 99 of the string or the 100th digit. This is a fairly surprising result since it is at such a significant digit. And, when navigating to the website described on the billboard, it turns out the website was taken down. Yet, many other sources have reported the same answer.\nApplication of this Problem\nPrime numbers are not just of interest because they are different from other numbers.\nPrime numbers are a mathematical singularity and therefore are of interest for research. In Pure Maths fields like Number Theory prime numbers play a huge role. Great figures in Mathematics devoted a lot of time to the pursuit of prime numbers such as Fermat, Euler and Wilson. But this problem is not just a novelty or just a point of interest. The frequency of prime numbers in irrational ones is of mathematical interest. Prime numbers are vital to the cryptography and security industry as prime numbers are used to seed encryption algorithms. Prime numbers are the basis of the up incoming currency called Bitcoins where computers solving an algorithm using prime numbers to seed the problem generate a currency. It is valued at over $200 per Bitcoin (lol tbt to 2013). Fermat’s Theorem itself is used to validate RSA’s encryption methods. Prime numbers are also a competitive endeavor. An extension of Lucas’s Primality Test is the Lucas–Lehmer primality test which is used to calculate larger primes that follow the form:\n$$M_{n} = 2^n - 1$$\nThese are called Mersenne primes. These primes are calculated as tests for new supercomputers and are part of a competition to calculate the largest prime number since it is easier to calculate one of these primes than any given one. The most recent one was calculated January 25, 2013 and had 17,425,170 digits. $e$ is also used to test computer systems, NASA itself calculated 5 million digits with their system The algorithms outlined in this paper are standard in the realm of computer science as not only benchmark tests and competitions but as key parts of security, privacy and the economy.\nConclusion\nThis paper set out to find the first 10 digit prime number in the digits of $e$. This seems to be a trivial problem when one thinks about the steps. It is only to test each set of 10 consecutive digits for primality until the first one is found. However, issues with the inherent capabilities of computers force a more complex solution than expected. A more precise $e$ required to begin testing which itself requires special classes to be implemented. Then the actually testing can be done with brute force, yet a solution like that is not scalable to find longer and longer primes in a set. Therefore tests like Wilson’s Theorem, Fermat’s Little Theorem, and the Lucas Primality Test need to be examined for possible implantation. Ultimately a solution was found in a singularly surprising spot. At the 100th digit the prime 7427466391 was found. This problem shows the overlap between computer science and mathematics and gives an introduction into Number Theory and the practices of the cryptography and security. It also was a challenging programming challenge that can help companies like Google discover new talent.\n\nLink to Source code: https://github.com/narendasan/google_e\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/digits-of-e/","title":"Finding the First 10 Digits Prime Number in the Digits of e"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/dl4agx/":{"body":"I wrote a post for the NVIDIA Developer Blog on how we implemented real-time autonomous vehicle perception using the specialized\nhardware available on the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Self Driving Computer.

This is exactly\nwhat happened when we got to the old TellApart office that Greylock converted into one of the best\nrun hackathon spaces I've been to. There was a chocolate fountain, a carnival outside with churros,\nfood trucks, a ping pong table and hammocks. So you can waste a bit of time exploring the space and\ntalking to people but ultimately you need to sit down and figure out what to do. Sitting side by\nside next to my team at the cleared out desk of some engineer we started talking about technologies we\nwanted to try out, looking up documentation and finding out that our genius idea was done 6 times before.\nI had a web page open and was telling my teammate next to me to look it up and thats when we had the idea for our project.\n\"Why can't I just drag my browser window onto your desktop?\"\nIt started out as a silly idea but as we thought about it, the ability to just open a page on someone\nelse's machine is actually really cool (given you do the work to curb spamming and other security\nconcerns). Especially in the one to many case, i.e. I open a window on all of my teammates screens. We also thought that the movemement of dragging the window off the screen was a nice intuitive interaction that is easy to remember since it feels contextual.\nNow you may ask why sending the URL isnt good enough and it is, but if you break down the steps to\ndo so you get:\n\nClick on the URL bar\nHighlight the entire URL (while there are shortcuts to do this, its \"not inuitive\" you need to create the muscle memory, and using the mouse can incure errors)\nCopy the URL\nPaste it\nSend the message\nEveryone else has to click on it\n\nThis is compared to:\n\nDrag the window off the screen\nThere is no step 2\n\nEkko\nSo cool idea, how do you implement it?\nEveryone on our team had Macs and we wanted to play with Swift so we chose to make a toolbar extention.\nIt creates a hotzone on the right hand side, where if a browser is dragged into it, it turns slightly grey and instantly the same website is opened on everyone else's machine. To limit the scope of the sharing we created rooms, so links are only share amongst users in that room.\nWe get the URL from the browser using AppleScript, which is an incredible feature of the operating system. AppleScript allows developers to access all sorts of\nunderlying APIs for different applications. In our case it let us query what the URL open in the current window of the browser is (on Firefox, Chrome and Safari).\nWe then used Firebase to manage the URL transmission to the different users in the room. Their Ekko instances will recive a notification and then open the browser and\nthe web page.\nIn concept it's really simple but in actual usage it was a pretty perfound experience. The first time I could share a web page with the flick of the mouse was a\nincredible moment. The judges agreed. We were able to allow them to play directly with the app on a couple of laptops and we could tell by the reactions on\ntheir faces the first time a window popped open with a funny meme that we had something good. Ultimately we won Top 10 at Greylock Hackfest but more importantly\nwe actually kept using Ekko when were working on class work or wanted to share a YouTube video long after we left the hackathon, a rare outcome for most hackathon projects.\nYou can checkout the source code for Ekko here:\n\nhttps://github.com/Perilynn/Ekko\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/ekko/","title":"Ekko and Greylock Hackfest 2015"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/hackillinois2017/":{"body":"\nThoughts after running Experience for HackIllinois 2016 about growth and direction of HackIllinois and Hackathons in general. This was written in May of 2016 with Andrew Kuznetsov as we were trying to assemble a vision of what HackIllinois could become.\n\nBackground\nHackIllinois was founded in 2014, just one year after the first MHacks, and 5 years after PennApps. For the past 3 years, HackIllinois has been refining the idea of the “College Hackathon”, by focusing on experience at scale; creating a large highly themed whimsical hackathon, which tries to provide as many resources as possible. As a result, HackIllinois has grown year over year to 1500 Hackers in 2016. It has grown to become a top class event in the world of hackathons, alongside MHacks, PennApps, HackMIT and more Quora - What are the best hackathons. HackIllinois traditionally has created an event to evangelize the hacker culture to new students by trying not to look at qualifications before admission (in fact admissions are mostly based around transportation), thereby making an event where people who are new to the world of hackathons can meet the true hackathon hackers.\nHowever it has become apparent from hacker feedback, the submissions and general observation, that HackIllinois is struggling to scale the experience further. Many hackers complain of long lines for food, the inability to get mentorship, not being accepted despite being a student at UIUC, and the event’s inability to handle so many submissions in the competition. The quality of submissions at college hackathons in general has fallen as well. Many of the first hackathon goers have graduated and left behind those who believe in a warped view of what hacking is. This new generation, who are now the organizers and major figures in the hacking community, were inundated by the CS culture during its current boom as they were being introduced to the hackathon community, and created a more concentrated form of the startup centric, founder-glorifying culture in Silicon Valley. This culture focuses more on being able to pitch ideas and imaging wild ways in which they might “change the world” than it does on the journey of hacking and the engineering behind it and now people are starting to reject it. This is clear to see in the submissions to HackIllinois 2016, where not all of the Top 10 hacks in either category had done any significant engineering work, however many make claims such as “ we solved 3rd world sanitation” with a project featuring 3 wires a couple LEDs and a SparkCore. The organizers of these hackathons are just as culpable as the hackers: by putting incentives on using company APIs, current hackathons only encourage this sort of hacking.\nIt is obvious that HackIllinois needs to change in order to continue delivering the same quality of experience to hackers. However, it must change within the greater context of the culture it represents. Hackathons are no longer growing, especially hackathons that focused on size over experience, (Hackathons that artificially limit the number of students will not see this effect for a year or two). The people who are interested in the college hackathons are not the same type of people that were setting up and attending these events in the past. MHacks is a poignant example - the entire leadership of the MHacks organizing committee did not return. As a consequence, the people who attend MHacks are more and more just Michigan students that want free food as other students are not seeing the value in traveling to Ann Arbor to sit and work on meaningless projects incentivized by API prizes. Hackathon Be Gone\nA Quick History of Hackathons\nThere are 2 places of origin for what is now the hackathon; both tied together by the people involved. The first event called a hackathon was in the 1990s, where 10 or so developers of BSD Unix, came together to prototype some ideas for the operating system. This idea transferred to Sun Microsystems as some of the founders of BSD were core engineers at Sun. At Java One, Sun had the first corporate hackathon. Developers were challenged to learn/use Java to create new applications for the Palm. These two events set the platform for what hackathons would be. Wikipedia - Hackathon\nAt their core, Hackathons are events that seek to accomplish several things at a very specific scale, showing what is possible with a technology, but often without pushing the limits of scalability or deployment in real world environment. Hackers either twist technologies to do something it was never supposed to do (think the top hardware hack at Hackillinois 2016 - Catch Me if You Can) or develop a prototype for a feature or idea.\nDuring the intervening years, the Hackathon tradition was shared and small groups would organize events to quickly make prototypes or explore new tech (ex: developing mobile apps with javascript - Apache Cordova). However, as Computer Science became more popular (read: sexy) a culture shift became apparent.  As popular culture started idealizing the concept of the startup, the hackathon was appropriated as a concentrated representation of that idea New York Times - The Hackathon. Importance shifted from blowing minds or prototyping a new idea to what food and swag is given out. Projects were expected to be presented as a groundbreaking piece of tech in the form of a startup competition pitch. The effect was immediate; people with very little deep technical knowledge began passing off company APIs, hardcoded backends, and frontend templates as original work in a bid to secure prizes. HH - Unsustainable Hackathons.\nProblems Facing HackIllinois\nThere are a bunch of issues that arise from the expectations of hackathons:\n\nInflux of business-minded individuals coming in with a business pitch and a coder believing they are holding the next Facebook™ in their hands.\nThe Code Evangelism Hackathon vision is no longer relevant.\n\nNo one learns anything after their first hackathon because the same technologies (and skills) are being used over and over again (Different frameworks don’t count, just as different languages don’t count).\nHackers rely on APIs for major compute power, competition has become geared at best applying an API at a problem.\nIt’s easier to plan events for beginners, after all you can teach them everything. However, not much thought is dedicated to providing for participants who are not first time programmers or hackathoners?\n\n\nNothing of substance is ever developed in hackathon because most of the heavy lifting is done by the APIs, nor is their incentive to do so. Virtually no projects survive the closing ceremony.\nCompanies that are not platform based (e.g. Amazon) see very little value in evangelizing their products at current style of hackathon.\n\nOther companies put on their own hackathons that are more effective at evangelize their systems.\n\nSun and Java One, Pebble and Pebble Rocks, Github and local hacknights, AT&amp;T and the AT&amp;T Dev Summit and Hackathon\n\n\n\n\nThe competitive skills that are developed at hackathons are geared toward prototyping, rather than teaching solid engineering.\n\nHackers cannot see a project through, will avoid good engineering for speed (Whatever Works Development). Reinforces the practice of deploying prototypes\nUnfortunately, they do not realize that this is poor development and try to apply the same strategy to real life situations\n\n\n\nA thread that mentions all these issues -  Hacker News - The Rising \"Hackathon Hackers\" Culture\n\n“We hired a dev that's very much like you [OP] described. We \"knew\" he was smart because he did well in some Hackathons. Had built some cool projects on his flashy portfolio. Went to the same university we went to, which is a top university in the world. Had good grades at said University. etc. He had all the markings of being a fantastic intern for us. About half way through his internship we had to fire him. He lacked the attention span for a long term, rigorous software development project. We later hired someone whom we evaluated very differently and it has been incredible. He's doing a fantastic job. Constantly questions our opinions about software and pushes the boundaries of our depth of understanding. To add to this, we knew the fired intern went on to another startup to keep doing whatever it is he thinks he's doing. The founders of that company ended up telling us the same exact problems were happening with them. Don't worry about these \"hackers\" and what they're doing. They'll all end up getting a reality check at some point. If they frustrate you, then just remember that the best revenge is living well.”\n\nMany of the students who lead the charge for hackathons now distance themselves from the culture because of what it now represents (Large exodus of Hackathon Hackers sub-groups from the HH community/brand in early 2016). These original students founded their own hackathons because of what they saw in industry or in the colleges of peers, and are now seeing them becoming calculated competitions for prizes. The system of prizes and especially API prizes reinforces this behavior. We can see this evidence of this trend in project distribution among prizes, and in the dearth of workshop and talk participants (and the subsequent need to incentivize their attendance) (HackMIT 2016).\nThe ever widening gap between the hacking community (HH, Hackathon goers and Organizers) and the tech community (employers, engineers, members of the FOSS movement, older hackers) is concerning. From the hacker perspective, a collegiate hackathon provides access to other fellow hackers and a handful of recruiters. From the perspective of the greater developer community, collegiate hackathons are prototyping competitions which reinforce a poor competitive mindset (read: faking tech demos), as well as fostering poor engineering practices Kevin Techonology - Preventing Cheating at Hackathons, targeting a very homogeneous set of people - 18-21 year olds with 1-5 years of programming experience. Unfortunately, due to the lack of mentorship, the cycle of poor development repeats itself: hackers learn from other hackers (company mentors are typically recruiters, evangelists or older hackathon goers, not engineers) and are then asked to mentor others. It is hard to see such a culture to continue to be a respected part of the CS community if something drastic is not done to change the values and the vicious cycle that has been created.\nThe Main Event\nThe MLH-style “College Hackathon” is dead, or it will be soon. @folz - Selling out and the death of hacker culture\nBut as always is the case, less active companies and institutions are still only discovering the basic idea. For the near future, Hackathons (and MLH beside it) will continue to expand to these new territories largely to continue growth. Despite this, the original college hackathon has peaked, and we can see the evidence in MLH’s newfound (2015-2017) focus in Code Evangelism, High School Hackathons, European Hackathons, and untouched colleges.\nHackIllinois is now faced with a choice, take the money, drink the kool-aid, and ride it to the end or try and create something new and start the new phase of hackathons. This is the time to do it while there is still some momentum in the community (among quite a few reasons to which we will get to later). It is increasingly harder to justify HackIllinois attendance (over others) as the more we continue along this path, the less unique we become.\nVision\nThere are entire subsets of students that are not being served by the current MLH infrastructure and it just so happens these are the passionate engineers, the founders of the hacking culture and collaborative minded engineers who understand the prestige of significant contributions to the greater community and growing that community. As an event, we need to focus on these technology and community drivers; people who are passionate about the technology and the journey of creating something new. This group of active community makers and developers define the original values of the hacking community and also are disenfranchised by what it has become. It is this group that HackIllinois needs to attract and impress, if we to change what hackathons represent. We need to examine and question the culture we have created, and advocated for.\nThat being said, a new idea that will pull in these hackers as well as the greater CS community and solve many of the issues facing hackathons today is the Open Source Initiative created at HackIllinois 2016.\nOpenSource@HackIllinois questioned everything about hackathons.\n\nWhy can only college students hack?\nWhy are teams only up to 4 people?\nCan we run a hackathon without prizes?\nWhat if people could work on previously existing projects?\nEtc.\n\nOpenSource@HackIllinois also presented solutions to common problems that faced hackathons:\n\nWhat happens to projects after the hackathon?\nHow do you make sure that people learn something?\nHow do you make sure hackers meet new people and develop meaningful connections?\nEtc.\n\nOpen Source harkens back to the original meaning of ‘hacker’, and  a hackathon that unifies the two would go a long way to start bringing the culture back to its roots.\n\n“Take a look at the free software community (which is incidentally very well-correlated with what the \"hacker\" community used to be 20-30 years ago, and has much more of a claim to being the intellectual heirs of that group than the hackathon crowd does or even the HN crowd does). There's a lot of focus on ethics and civil liberties, and maybe a bit too little focus on effective PR and on shipping, but it's very refreshing. As a concrete suggestion, LibrePlanet https://libreplanet.org/2015/ is next weekend at MIT, and free for students. Or see if there's a Debian group in your local area.” - Hacker News Poster (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9205177)\n\nThe way forward for HackIllinois is to recapture the old idea of what a hacker meant through fully embracing FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). In doing so, we may stave off the decline of the College Hackathon Scene, reintroduce a focus on the craft and journey of a hackathon, and on the brand of hacking and community contribution that is exemplified by groups like iOS Jailbreakers and Android ROM community.\nValues\nPre-MLH, Rutgers student Mike Swift wrote an excellent article on why not to run a hackathon http://theycallmeswift.com/2013/10/25/dont-throw-that-hackathon/ and it exemplifies exactly what should be avoided when throwing such an event. What the author says should be something that should be internalized at HackIllinois: “Hacks are just that… they are hacks”. Hacks are just pieces of code cobbled together - just as a writer in the flow spits words onto a page, a hacker wired in spits out code. And just as writers would never submit a first draft for publication, hackers should never presume that their project is done after the hackathon. Like a good writer, the hackathoner should make it stable and share it. No one should be going into a hackathon thinking they are going to change the world because that requires more than 36 hours and working at a scale hackathons cannot provide. That being said, hackathons are wonderful tools for 2 types of projects.\n\nCrank out a prototype\n\nIf there is an idea that has been itching in your head, a hackathon is a great place to put pen to paper\n\nThis traces back to the first hackathon at BSD.\nHopefully this turns into something more, a patch to a FOSS project that reaches millions of people or a brand new technology (will require more than 36 hours)\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrate a proof of concept\n\nHow can you make something do what it was never supposed to do\n\nThis goes back to the core of the hacking movement,\n\nExcellent example is Saurik and the Jailbreaking movement or ROM hackers for Android.\nAnother good one is the Car controller for Mario Kart  - Catch Me if You Can\n\n\nHopefully the hacker puts out a guide or at least the source so other can learn\n\n\n\n\n\nOne may see that these two categories are symbiotic. These categories do not presume anything past the restrictions of a hackathon, but focus on sharing the result, which is what hackathons are about.\nHackIllinois’ motto should be “Contribute Something Amazing”. Hackathons should not be about founding startup or curing cancer. They should be a place to create, contribute, and explore. Contribution could take the form of a discovery or a patch, and we should encourage people not just make something and leave it, they should feel proud and inspired enough to keep working and sharing it with others.\nApplications of existing APIs are not strong qualifiers.  A video search engine that glues two external APIs (one to process images and another to process text) with some basic engineering glue is not in the spirit of the ideal of make a contribution, since nothing new was learned. It is extremely important to notice that this protects the event from imminent data science projects that will visualize data provided from leveraging existing analysis on large open datasets.\nWhile the entire event is geared towards open source, that doesn’t mean the elimination of the unique whimsicality HackIllinois is well known for, since that is a major part of the HackIllinois brand and success.\nThe event should have 3 key values:\n\nStudents should be creating legitimate projects, either by contributing to the world of open source, or by developing novel uses of common (open source) technologies or devices and there should be a focus on getting those contributions released to the public (i.e. Open Licensing)\n\n\nHackIllinois should attract the most motivated students from around the nation. This can be done by the unique opportunity that is presented by being able to work with key people from the CS community.\n\n\nThe people who come to HackIllinois should represent various backgrounds i.e young, old, male, female etc.\n\n\n\nAnd the event should seek to be something\n\nWhimsical and Fun\nA unique experience that sets people on a new path\nA place where the FOSS community gets to interacts and mentor students.\nA place of mentorship and study at a depth not typical of a hackathon.\n\nInspiration\nOur inspirations are not other college hackathons, but rather meetups like Twillo BASH, or Greylock Hackfest.\nTwilio BASH is a small event tied to the Signal Conference. It featured a carnival type atmosphere with a bunch of games centered around the CS culture (e.g a virtual boat race where successfully debugging a code snip-it moves your boat ahead, a 4 v 4 person arcade game or a lego building competition). Winners of these games would earn tickets which could be exchanged for prizes like a NES or headphones. This might be a fun way to let people go home with something without the idea of judging and prizes. It would also be a great  way to take a break.\nGreylock Hackfest exemplifies the execution goals of HackIllinois: mentorship is plentiful, there is an extremely wide variety of participants, and events like a midnight carnival or a chocolate fountain provided memorable experiences. Submission-wise, this was a very selective hackathon, and as a result, API hacks were rare. Many hacks were full platforms or clean apps, there was even one group trying to recreate Project Soli from a RC car https://atap.google.com/soli/.\nThese events should serve as inspiration for how to make an event memorable but they don't represent the values that HackIllinois should stand for. Ultimately what we should aim for is the vibe of a quirky LAN party: Lots of food, lots of fun, and lots of people having a good time with each other while learning and contributing. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5302940\nWhat HackIllinois 2017 looks like\n\n300-400 external (non-UIUC) hackers, hard max.\n\nAll UIUC students are accepted to walk in, however swag and food is only promised to those who pre-register.\nTarget ratio of 1:1 Non-UIUC to UIUC\nAdmission is partially random and partially via a completely objective merit based system (e.g admissions puzzle)\nNo cap on project team size.\n\n\nRegistration must be put out in late Nov, early Dec to give us time to react to demand.\nAll projects made and submitted during HackIllinois 2017 should be open released as open source under a FOSS license (e.g GPL, MIT, UIUC/NCSA, CC) to be eligible for judging\nA significant portion of the attendees (not counting the 300-400 + UIUC students) should be active developers on Open Source projects\nTarget 30% active Open Source developers.\nAny Open Source project represented must send min 3 mentors but ideally 5-10\n\nThis should enable a ratio mentor to student ratio of 1:2-3 while keeping groups around 10 to 15.\n\nThis means personal attention and resiliency from people who dip.\nThis was learned from attempting the small group size model in 2016 with 1 mentor and 3-4 hackers. Ultimately small issues (hackers leaving, mentor sleeping in etc.) had an outsized impact on the success of the team. Due to some natural reorganization during the event we saw that a low mentor hacker ratio but large group size made it easier to react to these issues\n\n\n\n\nSponsors of HackIllinois 2017 should have interest in Open Source and should send 3-5 Engineers to work with students on one of their open source projects\nThe company showcase should be named a tech showcase, where they alongside the open source projects, present an open source technology  and the problems that need to be solved.\n\nThis occurs during the team matching phase at the beginning of the hackathon.\n\n\nSubmissions for judging should be of one of 2 categories\n\nPatch or Feature to existing Open Source Platform\n\nE.g Contribution to Ubuntu 16.10\n\n\nA start of a new Open Source project (could be PoC with future)\n\nE.g If ACM wanted to open source Groot\nCan be mainly Proof of Concept, but must have clear path forward. The ‘mario in a car’ project from HackIllinois 2016 would only qualify if the team had clearly shown a path toward emulating other key-presses and playing other games, etc.\nCondition: There must be a team of min 3 people who worked on this project for it to be eligible\n\n\n\n\nLogically, Web APIs will not be a part of this hackathon\nVIP Speakers and judges should have a hard bent towards open source\n\nE.g Chris DiBona, Director of Open Source - Google\n\n\nWorkshops and Tutorials need to have a strong open source basis and should ideally be put on by the projects not the event. Some should exist specifically to introduce developers to the FOSS flow.\n\nHow to choose a license\nHow to submit a patch, Pull Request\nTool chain and build tools\n\n\nPrizes should not be monetary\n\nShould be items or experiences such as\n\nCompute time on Blue Waters\nTickets to DefCon\nEtc.\n\n\n\n\nA special “Test of Time” prize should be awarded 3-6 months after the event for the group who has made the most progress\nHackIllinois should still maintain its whimsicality\n\nI.e Strong theming\n\n\nHackIllinois should encourage healthy hacking\n\nPlaces to actually sleep\n\nSet up hosts for example.\n\n\nHave healthy food\n\n\nUse the opportunity to showcase Champaign-Urbana\n\nMidnight tours\n\n\nTry something like Twilio Bash to get people's minds off hacking for a bit\n\nAllows students to win prizes while not making the hackathon overly competitive\nHave games like Debugging Boat Race\n4v4 Arcade Battle\nLego Building comp.\nEtc.\n\n\nImprove event long activities\n\nCluehunt (a favorite amongst hackers)\n\n\nMake sure that Hardware and Software Open Source Projects are represented\n\nHardware\n\nArduino\nRaspberry Pi\nRepRap 3D Printers\n\n\nSoftware\n\nReact\nDebian\nPython\n\n\n\n\nA final part of expo at the end of the event should have the groups (all teams competing + any leftover sponsors) presenting ways to get further involved in their projects\n\nWhat is Open Source?\n\n“Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose” -Wikipedia\n\nAt it’s core, Open Source is little more than providing your project’s source code (read: having it up on github), and attaching a Open Source software license to it, in which you release your ability to sue people for using it. Since we live in an age of github repositories and stackoverflow code snippets, the idea that you can be sued over using a code snippet from the internet is beyond foreign. Many don’t realize that before Open Source won out as the dominant way to develop software, code simply wasn’t shared openly on github: it was hidden and viciously protected by lawyers as proprietary software. The simple idea of releasing your code for free for people to use and play around with was immensely powerful: people began contributing to large projects in their free time, collaboratively creating immensely complex software projects that would become some of the software we know today (Linux, Python, etc..).  Open Source so crushed that we don’t realize there could have a been a completely different historical outcome had everyone stuck to their lawyers and kept their codebases proprietary. O'Reilly - Open Source Won.\nThe Open Source ideals do not stop at software. The Open Hardware is a growing community as well, featuring the open 3D printing platform RepRap, Arduino, and more. There are efforts and many other disciplines, Biology, Design, Architecture that all are looking to incorporate open source ideals into their workflows. Open Design [IDEO] - Avacado, Open Interaction Design [Facebook] - [Origami](https://github.com/facebook/origami, Open 3d-printing  [RepRap] http://reprap.org/, Open Source Architecture [Emerging] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_architecture)\nNote: Open Source is not a theme like wilderness or space. It is a focus like hardware or software. HackIllinois should still have a separate theme. Which leads to a secondary point, the theme does not need to be interconnected with focus.\nWhy Open Source\nEmbracing the culture of Open Source will gain us access to this community and the people who run it. While it may seem that embracing the FOSS movement is not a major change for our generation, just the shift in terminology will have deep impact on the mindset with which hackers come in with, as the FOSS movement traditionally embodies a spirit of open collaboration and building out software for the greater good.\nOpen Source also brings these added benefits:\nMany great relationships in CS span generations Adve and Latner, Clark and Andreesen. This is an opportunity unique to HackIllinois where you actually meet developers who are not your age.\nMore than just recruiters and hackathoners. The current Hackathon paradigm focuses on prizes and flair, leaving mentorship to a desperate call for peer mentoring among hackathoners and recruiters who attend the event regardless. It is at the point that no participant (barring first timers) expects to learn anything from the mentorship system, aside from fixing an issue.\nExisting strong traction among sponsors and participants HackIllinois 2016 demonstrated very strong traction among Open Source participants, from both participants and mentors, despite a sideshow execution. Interest is on the rise, with Chris DiBona, Google’s head of open source reaching out after hearing about the initiative. Google’s summer of code annually connects ~200 Open Source organizations with about ~1000 students. This is a big deal.\nSolves continuity problem Hackathons are often looked down as competitions that go nowhere and contribute nothing. Open Source, by it’s nature, counters this trend.\nOpen Source tends to attract strong developers It is no secret that legitimate developers at some point are drawn to Open Source, whether of good will or the prestige of contributing. Companies know this. Open Source organizations know this.\nVery Unique No other college hackathon has done anything significant in the Open Source space, the potential to become a groundbreaking and original leader in the hackathon space is wide open. As a result, there is also uniquely additional opportunities for media coverage / hype.\nInherently high visibility By the nature of Open Source, the event proselytizes itself. Participating organizations will broadcast their presence, and the work itself is thrust upon the community.\nWhy the Hybrid Model does not work\nThe obvious compromise is to make open source a larger part of the event as it currently stands. However, the hybrid model dilutes the strengths of Open Source and ultimately this means less people benefit from what is been shown to be a superior model, and the software and hardware aspects lose out due to a less resources and time devoted (you end up half assing both parts). This is best exemplified by the feedback given by hackers in the Open Source Program:\n\n“The Open Source program was a great experience for our team, because we finally had time, mentorship, and resources to further an open source project that we had actually started. However, despite HackIllinois' calling for projects that would outlive the hackathon, most of our team felt like the Open Source program was a sideshow during the event... We really appreciated the intent behind Open Source, but a lot of activities at the event didn't back up its goals.“ - Open Source Hacker HackIllinois 2016\n\nWhile the Open Source Program at HackIllinois 2016 was a pilot program, the criticism was warranted. Most people if given the choice will do what feels normal and and that is contrary to the goals of the event.\nThe battle between breadth and depth harkens back to business models and the battle between horizontal (Google) and vertical integration (Apple). As a champion of horizontal integration, Google tends to get a little involved in each space, being dominate in some and doing woefully poor in others (ehm, Google+). Apple is the opposite, controlling every detail that goes into their products, but as a result can only focus on a handful of products . Neither company’s approach is particularly better in the overall business space as both annually alternate as the “world’s most valuable company”. VentureBeat - Vertical vs. Horizontal\nHowever, only one of these models truly fits within the context of HackIllinois values. As an organization, we seek to create a hackathon that provides the absolute best experience while advocating for this different style of hacking. By trying to commit to all initiatives, we do not show commitment to any specific values and thereby endorse a mediocre product: the MLH style hackathon.\nNote: A hackathon becomes legendary when it goes hard in one aspect of their experience. MHacks used to go hard at sheer scale, sacrificing food quality and experience quality, yet consistently making it very well known hackathon. Making the same hackathon as others, with a theme and a couple extra features is not a solid path to that success.\nWhat about the newbies?\nIf the expectation of hackers is to make novel uses of tech or add features to the most popular open source projects, the topic of the fate of beginners naturally arises. There are 2 prongs to the strategy.\n\nStudents looking to primarily learn skills such as how to use an API or mobile development will find their needs equally satisfied by the 50+ other collegiate hackathons.\nStudents looking to contribute to FOSS but don’t have the technical chops yet or the confidence to move at the speed of React or Angular, can contribute to an open source initiative OpenHackathon, an open source effort we are forming that aims to create the technical tools and providing documentation necessary for anyone to create their own hackathon. This includes the software for registration, check-in, mentorship, dashboard, mobile apps, how to approach sponsors, a prototyping board and more. All of this tech and information will be released under GPL and Creative Commons. This gives the opportunity for students can work alongside other developers passionate in the EdTech / Hackathon space, while providing a high visibility avenue to contribute, while not having the intensity of a large FOSS project.\n\nIncentives and Value Proposition\nThere are always the questions of incentives to attend and compete, not to mention sponsoring or mentoring. There are two parts to answering these questions: what is our audience, and what is their motivation.\nHackers\nHackers broadly fall into three camps: those who enter to win (Competition Hackers), those who enter to spend time with their friends/work on a project/enjoy the process of hacking (Casual Hackers), and those who enter to join the movement or learn (Curious Hackers).\nAttracting competition hackers should never be a focus of HackIllinois. At their core, these participants are competitors who have developed (and are constantly improving) a formula for winning prizes (fairly famous example http://thetech.com/2014/11/14/hackmit-v134-n54). They only care about the monetary benefit of their attendance, and will strongly affected by any any changes to prizes. Aside from not creating a sustainable spirit, this does not mesh well with HackIllinois’ or the FOSS movement’s values.\nHackers who are solely entering to learn coding or join the college hackathon movement, should not be our main focus as there already exist  50+ hackathons out there focused on this demographic, though we think that the event would be helpful to them, however it is going to be more demanding that many of the hackathons they are used to.\nWe need to target  hackers who are looking to contribute to the greater Software Engineering community (the Free and Open Source Software movement) or are looking to work on projects of substance. It may seem exclusive but creating a beginner-oriented hackathon is (at the time of this writing) incredibly redundant throughout the hackathon space.\nOur core target group is people who feel disenfranchised by the current hackathon culture, people who understand or seek to understand Free and Open Source Software. As noted previously, these people  are typically great engineers looking for a push to contribute to the things they have used or seen. Initially, these hackers will be skewed toward a certain profile, but provided they have great experiences (good food, good fun and good people) they will spread the word and bring more and more of the other two groups next year and the year after. These participants will also understand that good work never goes unnoticed, and see that they can potentially get an employee referral based on their work. By bringing Open Source to the hackathon scene, we stand to make a significant change in Open Source involvement at the college level.\nIncentives\nThat being said, in order to increase the probability of people attending, several significant incentives must be available. The first should be an incredible event in and of itself, and we are able to leverage the tremendous reputation of HackIllinois in this respect. . The next incentive is a  form of travel compensation. From our experience during HackIllinois 2016, we know that it is important that well defined and clear-cut qualification criteria should be put in place. As a potential qualification for a  target of 300-400 non UIUC attendees, is the following offer of acceptance to the event:  hackers more than 350 miles (Ann Arbor) to 500 miles (Pittsburgh) away will be given reimbursements but will in summation not make up more than ⅓ of the accepted hackers. Criteria for reimbursements could be determined from a variety of factors, from just distance to prior contributions to FOSS or other hacker-related criteria (e.g. demographic representation).\nAs many people will be traveling, another possible incentive is the ability to stay in a UIUC students dorm, HackMIT style. This creates an opportunity to forge a connection with someone at UIUC, someone who could showcase UIUC and make sure to take care of their guest and others visiting, ensuring there is always a place to sleep and safely store belongings. It also encourages healthy hacking (a key point often brought up by critics of the college hackathon scene), and insures that each participant has someone to ask when they need something or have a problem. This is key to making new and old hackers alike feel welcome.\nPrizes\nIn this new pivoted event, prizes are somewhat obvious but need to be overhauled from previous years. There should no longer be a 1st, 2nd, 3rd place hack because frankly it makes no sense - deciding priority between the top several hacks has always been difficult and very subjective and only creates division and salt.\nOne possible method of allocating prizes is a vote of all participants. Participants would vote for: “Best Contribution to a FOSS Project” (like if someone added a new graphics driver to Ubuntu), and “Most Interesting New FOSS Project”. Particularly, one “Test of Time” prize should be given 3-6 months after the end of HackIllinois and given to the team that has been the most productive after the end of HackIllinois. The endorsement it gives the winner, that huge members of the FOSS and hacking community liked their submission the best is something truly special.\nThe prizes would take the form of items that will provide new experiences or resources, not just money. Good examples are items like tickets to conferences such as DefCon, SXSW, WWDC, Google I/O, and O’Reilly OSCON, items such as a GTX 1080 (great for CUDA and Deep Learning)  or very unique prizes such as a couple hours on Blue Waters.\nSince HackIllinois is only giving out about 3 top prizes (we do want to avoid sponsor prizes since that doesn’t really jive with the FOSS mentality) a prize giving event such as Twilio Bash, carnival type atmosphere, and CS-related minigames with prizes that can be bought with won tickets (e.g. NES, flash drives, HackIllinois swag and company swag) may provide the same thrill of having something to take home (while not just being something you queue in line for upon registration and leave with).\nThe Question of Initiatives\nFrom data gathered from 3 prevalent hackathons (HackIllinois, MHacks, BoilerMake). The idea of separating segments of the hacking population into initiatives adds a lot of complexity for very little added benefit.\nWe saw in 2016, 20% of submissions were hardware projects (16% if you don't include VR and smart watches) , 21% in 2015 (10% if you don't include VR and smart watches) , and 16% in 2014 (11% is you don't count VR and smart watches) for HackIllinois. We had 216, 180, and 135 submissions total for 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively\nMhacks 6 had 15% (12% if take out VR and smartwatch only hacks) out of 276 submissions, MHacks 5 had 19% (11% if you take out VR + smartwatches) out of 274 submissions\nBoilermake, the hardware hackathon got 21% (19% without smartwatches or VR) in 2015 out of 84 submissions, 24% in 2014 (20% without smartwatches (10% of which featured the boilermake badge)) out of 99 submissions\nThe increase at HackIllinois 2016 is most likely due the increased availability of hackable hardware. Intel pulled hard here, as well as us not focusing on having every type of resistor but more stuff like myo, drones, arduino shields, etc.\nExperience\nFor the hacker, the value of an open source event comes from several key experiences . Primarily,  it lowers the learning curve for getting involved in FOSS, a very rewarding but initially intimidating community . This is a gap that many people find hard to cross and having someone to hold your hand through the process is tremendously reassuring . Once students cross the gap, being involved in FOSS is as simple as committing to Github - it is no longer otherworldly. Throughout their experience, students will learn about aspects of FOSS that are not talked about outside the FOSS circles such as licensing, governance, communication and organization . Students will make valuable connections with people in and out of college and create connections that will last beyond the hackathon, not just from a personal perspective (as happens in most events), but also as a technical/developer peer.  As participants  will be working with the mindset that their code will be used and freely distributed, they will  be required to adhere to good engineering practices and as a result have something to be proud off / show off at the conclusion of the event. By closing ceremony,  participants will head home having had a good time, having learned a lot in a unique developer ecosystem, met some top tier people and a full bag of swag and prizes.\nMentors\nMentors would want to come to HackIllinois because it is a wonderful platform to find new people to contribute to their projects. It is also a way to showcase their projects in front of companies and students, and just as companies do in traditional hackathons ( representatives of FOSS projects do have an interest in evangelizing their projects). Mentoring  is also a great way to get involved in education; training the next generation of engineers in good engineering practices. Benefits should include hotels for the night between Sat and Sun, and eligibility for prizes just like the hackers.\nMentorship\nMentorship should consist of large groups i.e 10 - 15 hackers, and ~3-5 mentors for each project. We learned from Open Source of HackIllinois 2016 that the most successful groups are those that can lose or add people as necessary, while keeping the ratio between hackers and mentors low. It is imperative that participating projects bring as many mentors as they can.\nOutreach should be based around projects,  e.g. React, Angular, Tensorflow, Debian, Ubuntu, ASP.NET.\nHaving high profile projects well represented at HackIllinois is  key to making Open Source work. Using the networks created by Google Summer of Code, the Apache Foundation and others will give us a way to expand our contacts and put us in touch with more projects.\nPotential VIPs (Speakers or Judges)\nChris DiBona, head of Google Open Source (!!!) has already reached out. Other great speakers would include\n\nSaurik (spoke last year, Cydia)\nJuan Bennet (spoke last year and was a favorite, IPFS)\nJames Gosling (Java)\nLinus Torvalds\nVikram Adve, Chris Lattner (Creators of LLVM)\nBrendan Eich, Jamie Zawinski (UIUC Alumni, creator of Javascript and co-founder Mozilla Foundation)\nAndy Rubin, et. al. (Android)\nBjarne Stroustrup (C++ creator)\nGuido van Rossum (Python Creator)\n\nAnyone from any organization within Google Summer of Code 2016. It’s 176 orgs, you can’t really miss.\nSponsors\nSponsors can point to this event as a huge signal that they are committed to Open Source, something that many companies try to do but struggle to find an avenue to do so through. By sponsoring HackIllinois, a company is investing in the next generation of open source  not only with their dollars but by getting their hands dirty sitting down with people and writing code. As in hackathons of year past, they will still benefit from the traditional hackathon perks, resumes, having a recruiter on site etc. However, they will now  be  converting a set of hackathon goers into contributors (more than just developers)  for their platforms, and will benefit from the exposure in such a high profile community (Hackathon-FOSS). Sponsoring the event will also present the opportunity to gain mindshare with a very productive set of hackers who are known for creating and maintaining more involved projects, something more valuable to a company than the broadcast approach to API advertising. As a result, a participating sponsor has more to take home than API usage numbers, they have attracted elite developers, found collaborators to improve or maintain Open Source resources, and exposed themselves to the community as champions of furthering the community they sponsor.\nWho Sponsors an Open Source Hackathon\nProminent examples of companies that make Open Source a core part of their value system include: Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, CoreOS, Mesosphere, Meteor and Databricks. Some of these companies have explicitly reached out to get involved with Open Source (specifically, [Chris DiBona]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_DiBona, head of Google Open Source). Google’s Summer of Code annually connects ~1,000 students to ~200 Open Source projects.)\nSponsors from last year involved in Open Source\n\nGoogle\nApple\nFacebook\nMicrosoft\nAirbnb\nA16z\nKPCB\nYahoo\nJetBrains\nSalesforce\n\nPotential Sponsors\n\nCoreOS\nDatabricks\nCanonical\nDocker\nRedHat\nMozilla\nGithub (!!!)\nMongoDB\nYelp\nNvidia\nOpenAI\n\nNote: Something important about reaching out concerning Open Source is to hit an engineer or director of the project because recruiters may not see the benefit immediately as an engineer would. Having an engineer on the inside, especially higher up in the organization will make our jobs much easier as they can help advocate for the importance of supporting FOSS.\nPotential Projects\n\nTensorflow\nCaffe\nRuby\nPython\nGo\nArduino\nAngular\nReact\nNode\nDebian\nUbuntu\nArch\nOpenSUSE\netc.\n\nNote. Be careful when reaching out to FOSS groups to use the correct terminology. Many groups (e.g GNU) will tell you to go away if you use the term Open Source or Free Software with the wrong group. It is worthwhile to have a briefing on the differences between free software and open source and to research the groups before reaching out. When in doubt use the term FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). It will also be important in terms of branding to make sure HackIllinois is a FOSS hackathon not an Open Source Hackathon for similar reasons. Note that many of these organizations are interconnected (e.g Apache) and thus it is important to create a strategy that hits the most people personally without spamming.\nStaff\nThe value proposition and incentives for the staff is important as well if we are to avoid the staff churn by other large hackathons (read: MHacks). By pivoting to Open Source, the staff will feel that they are part of something actively growing, brand new, and in control of a very significant new paradigm. Not only are individual staff members getting more responsibility, they are in a unique position to shape a completely new movement in the Hackathon space. If HackIllinois continues to be a “college hackathon” many of the people who have the most to contribute will not stick around, because there is nothing to solve. Chris McAvoy of Mozilla Open Badge has an analogy for this:\n\n“The attackers and defenders of an empire. In an empire, no one is eager to stick around and defend what is captured, just as developers are drawn to active development and not documentation of what has been created, despite the importance of doing so. “\n\nHackIllinois in 2-3 years\nHackIllinois has the potential to be the Open Source version of WWDC or SXSW (though there are also other great events such as OSCON or All Things Open), especially in the sense of evangelizing Open Source to those who have yet to be exposed. It could be where people who are interested in Open Source come to meet each other, work on projects and listen to the biggest names in open source speak. UIUC has one of the most storied traditions of Open Source software, rivaling Berkeley (BSD, RISC-V, Mesos, etc.) and MIT (GNU) with Javascript, Firefox, LLVM and more. If we can get enough people who are not just students to come and work, we may have something extremely special that no other university could rival (especially assuming we get there first).\nThe Organization\nHackIllinois must fully commit to a transition from an event staff to a real year-round organization to back this shift to Open Source. This ensures that there are always community members ready to get involved while maxing the utility of each staff member. The current model of 15-30 people working year-round on putting on HackIllinois (contacting mentors, contacting hackers, sponsors etc.) and the rest running other events within CS/ECE community is a step in the right direction. HackNights is a good start, however we can leverage existing CS communities to put on events like a GameJam with Gamebuilders or putting on the Datasummit with ADSA. This has the twofold benefit of creating sustainable (each will be learning experience for the staff) and interesting events (empowering specialists to put on a great event). As an organization, HackIllinois can use these events as another avenue of fundraising for the main event as multiple companies will be interested in private events depending on their recruiting focus. This opens the possibility of focusing on companies that strongly align and add value to the main event, while developing stronger, more specialized sponsor-community relations in these private events.  As a result, we can concentrate companies who are truly serious about supporting our vision and not tagging along for recruiting or platform evangelization (as is the common case in today’s hackathons admittedly).\nVision\nThis grand vision of this pivot questions HackIllinois’ current position in the CS @ ILLINOIS ecosystem - does HackIllinois just put on events or does it mean more? HackIllinois should be the representation of the hacker movement at UIUC: it should work to move the idea of hacking from prizes and startups (which quite frankly aligns better with Founders/54.io) to creative ideas and making something that changes how people think or makes something better. Illini Hackers is a shell of an organization that often refers to itself as “just a facebook group”. This should not be the way it is: hackers should have a place and set of resources at their disposal, whether it is the ability to checkout hardware for a hackathon, to travel scholarships, or busses arranged (all of which can be provided by HackIllinois Org currently). It will also make HackIllinois a more cohesive part of the hacker community, where organizers and attendees are the same set of people and are constantly in touch with a variety of other groups,  other university’s hacking organizations, companies, etc.. It also ensures that HackIllinois will always be run by hackers, people who are in the loop and know what needs to change about hackathons. This alleviates an issue that other large hackathons are suffering through (read: MHacks), where the hackers and the organizers are starting to split into two bipartite sets (and often averse to unification). Through unification, we open more opportunities for hackers and organizers, as they will always have either other’s knowledge to tap.\nServices and Roles\nThe organization should be split broadly into two parts, one focusing on the hackers of UIUC and the other on putting on the events.\nThe Hackers\nThere should be one person elected as the representative of the Hackers, his or her role is to provide organization and resources to the hackers. This includes being the point of contact for other hackathons, organizing busses, setting up hardware loans, and scholarships. Scholarships in particular should be a point of importance to the hacker representative. It may be tempting for people to apply for a scholarship so they get a free trip to some other University, a good condition of acceptance to mitigate maybe being that hackers awarded a scholarship are required to make some sort of contribution to the FOSS community at the hackathon they are attending. This will continue HackIllinois’ commitment to FOSS and be a valuable motivation for hackers to get more involved in FOSS. This could range from a small platform the hacker creates to hacker contributing to a major FOSS project. Perhaps this representative can contact other universities hacking organizations to set up interesting remote events, arrange to have hosts for UIUC hackers and more. Overall, this side of the organization is responsible for organizing the hackers: through a tutorial series, small codejams in the middle room of ACM, or just getting them to come to HackNights, as well as managing relationships with other hacking organizations. At the minimum this side of the organization should have a general meeting once a semester to remind people of the resources available and of upcoming hackathons that semester.\nThe Organizers\nThe Organizers’ role is to put on HackIllinois events. They should be focusing on HackIllinois but also work to engage people in the hacker community through events and opportunities at UIUC. Obviously, this includes the main event but should extend beyond. Events such as HackNights are vital. In addition to the above, they should be looking for ways to present people with the chance to get involved on campus in hacking and FOSS in creative ways, as well as connecting the UIUC community with outside groups.\nStructure\nThe face of the organization should be the director(s) of the HackIllinois event, since they can represent both the interests of the hackers and organizers as a result of the relationships (with the department and other organizations) built during the planning and execution of the Main Event. The five main leads should consist of the representative of the hackers, the director of HackNights and the 3 major branches of HackIllinois, forming a balanced team that keeps the hackers in mind while still remaining conscious of the requirements of putting on a hackathon.\nMeetings and Workflow\nThe format for meetings for each brand/subgroup will be a little different.\nIlliniHackers\nIlliniHackers should have at least one general meeting at the beginning of each semester just like UIUC’s IEEE Chapter, that reminds people of the services that IlliniHackers can provide, the hackathons for the coming semester, and to get feedback on which people would like transportation to. This is essential to starting to build a community. Further meetings should be organized by the Hacker representative and may include tutorials and workshops. IlliniHackers should also strongly encourage attendance at HackNights.\nHackIllinois\nAs HackIllinois Staff has decreased in size, one weekly meeting is all that is required to remain synced. A second weekly meeting may be put on in conjunction with the organizers of HackNights in the style of the HackIllinois 2016 staff meetings. This will give students a chance to learn from the HackIllinois Staff and for the staff to consider succession and new hires. HackIllinois should be actively looking to bring more people on as they prove themselves, and all members of this group should be aware of the sheer amount of work that is required to make HackIllinois happen. TL;DR: Hire slow, fire never (ideally).\nHackNights\nHackNights should have one meeting a week with more if necessary for the success of a planned event. This meeting should include the organizers of HackIllinois to serve as mentors and ensure that the greater organization's interests are maintained.\nOpenHackathon\nSoftware and documentation developed for OpenHackathon should be created in the process of creating HackIllinois and the HackNights. However, there should be someone to maintain the organization, accept pull requests to the code base, and maintain overall presence.\nRegarding Slack\nSlack was found to be a great method of communication in the planning of HackIlinois 2016. However, several key lessons were learned. First, only active organizers who are working for the Organizers side of the org should have access, signified by having a hackillinois.org email (which should be cleaned each year). IlliniHackers can have its own org wide slack, but might not be necessary since there already exists a Facebook group.\nAlmost everything on the HackIllinois Slack should be public (minus budget discussions which should be confined to the Director, the head of HackNights, the 3 Department heads for HackIllinois and the representative of the hackers). This means that anyone who wants to contribute ideas can do so to any part of the organization. In addition, this will ensure that ideas and themes are more easily shared among all parties. Tiers of Slack access was the predominant reason most of Hackillinois 2016 staff felt that they did not know what was going on, in addition to stifling inter-department conversation within the HackIllinois organizing team. Maintaining this transparency  also serves to further respect the time that people are putting into this organization by not presuming that only certain people should be allowed to comment or be informed on certain topics. Further, individuals’ contributions to this open slack will expose solid candidates for future roles in HackIllinois, as these contributions are a solid metric by which to recruit.\nSlack Layout\n\nPublic\n\n#general &lt;- @channel disabled here (for non admins)\n#random &lt;- @channel disabled here\n#hackillinois (general for hackillinois)\n#hacknights (general for hacknights)\n#hackillinois_outreach\n#hackillinois_branding\n#hackillinois_experience\n#hackillinois_systems\n#hacknight_[date] &lt;- these are small staffs so further breakdown is not needed\n\n\n\nPrivate\n\n#leadership\n\nLeadership of major branches of the org + treasurers + active advisors\n\n\n#advisors\n\nPast directors and core who still want to help\n\n\n\nAny further private communication can go through DMs\nAdhering to this layout will maximize transparency within the organization, excellent for avoiding the creation of factions and discontent.\nBranding / Brand Management\nIlliniHackers\nIlliniHackers should be the presumptive name of the unified organization that represents the hackers and the organizers of the event. It will also be used to refer to the hackers themselves. We currently have admin rights to the FB group though admin rights to FB page need to be acquired. As noted above, IlliniHackers also must grow into an actual community past a loose collection of hackathon goers. This includes outreach programs, like hardware checkout, and scholarships.\nNote: ‘IlliniHackers’ should be stylized to have no space to mirror the branding of HackIllinois and HackNights.\nHackIllinois\nHackIllinois is the flagship event of the IlliniHackers/HackIllinois organization, its brand has been maintained over the years as a whimsical, highly produced hackathon. This image must be maintained while integrating the Open Source aspect. This means that the same level of art, design and execution must be maintained.\nHackNights\nHackNights are events put on by the unified IlliniHackers/HackIllinois organization that serve several purposes: they train the next generation of HackIllinois Staff, work to serve those who may not want to attend hackathons but still want to be apart of the community, and allow fundraising. HackNights should be individually branded and themed toward the topic of focus but should strive to have the same level of production as the main event.\nOpenHackathon\nOpenHackathon is a FOSS initiative to give people the resources and software to make throwing a hackathon as easy as possible. We already have control of a domain (openahackathon.org), github org (/open-hackathon) and twitter account (@openhackathon). What is left is to craft a brand around this movement, with a set of design guidelines and terms of usage to protect the brand.\nHackNights\nVision\nHackNights serve multiple purposes both within the organization,  department, and greater community. HackNights are the training ground for our next HackIllinois Staff members, where they can run an event at a smaller scale and learn the skills required to plan and execute events. This comes from the experience of smaller CS events Flight_196 and SAIL/Splash, where alums of those events were more tuned into the requirements of putting on an event, e.g. getting food, booking rooms and facilities, sponsors, making engaging content etc. For companies, HackNights are an opportunity to hold a more interesting/specialized techtalk, either via a tutorial &amp; hack structure or just a pure ‘use-our-platform’ event. Finally, HackNights are an entry point for many new hackers to get involved within a low stakes environment and for more experienced hackers to learn about new tools. This will make a great substitute for the sort of targeted intro level workshops that were part of HackIllinois (How to Make a Mobile App, How to Use Node, What is Azure, etc.)\nEach HackNight should have a technology focus. This focus may be platform based (such as Microsoft Azure), or a more broad theme such as games (similar to a GameJam). Each HackNight should also have a domain-related sponsor attached, who is responsible for funding the event and providing (some to all) mentorship.  If possible, HackNights may also want to partner with a group within the University who focus on the topic. For instance EA could sponsor a gamejam with Gamebuilders providing some mentorship, or IDEO sponsor a design hackathon with Design for America.\nDespite a focus on a technology, the organizers should still try to bring the HackIllinois whimsicality to the event as well. This may not have to be done through thematic choices, it could be through mini games, or some other method (the creative decisions to which we leave as an exercise to the reader).\nAs previously noted, HackNights should also feature the same sort of attention to design and branding that HackIllinois does. This means assets should be created (e.g FB banner image), good graphical layout practices should be adhered to and a global set of branding guidelines should be created in conjunction with HackIllinois to serve as a starting point.\nTarget Audience\nObviously we want to target people who are members of the CS community, but we should also be looking to engage people around campus, whether it means having a hardware HackNight in ECEB, or a Bio inspired HackNight. In a generic sense, the goal of HackNights should be introduce people to what hacking as an activity and culture is, in some unique context/domain, and thus the target audience is wide.\nEngagement and Incentives\nPast HackNights efforts were met with varying success. The ACM tradition of a ‘start of the year’ hacknight was met with great engagement as it was as much hacking as you could get on campus outside of HackIllinois in Fall 2013. The HackNight in the beginning of Fall 2014 was sponsored by Dropbox and also had great engagement. However, as time worn on, the vibe shifted to working on homework while taking advantage of the free food as people became more numb to the novelness of hacking. There a number of ways to mitigate this and it starts with strongly differentiating coming to a HackNight and staying home and hacking. The primary way to do this is a huge amount of personal mentorship. If you can present mentorship more personalized than stackoverflow, then people will come to learn and ask questions (even if debugging). The second part of the strategy is to broaden the focus from just CS majors, to people who have yet to catch the hacking bug. An an example, if a bunch of design majors are invited, their enthusiasm will alter the atmosphere because they bring something new to the table (and to continue the metaphor, we bring something new to theirs). Having mini games w/ associated prizes will also help, as it changes the feel from staring at a screen writing code to more of a LAN party feel. Prizes will help the atmosphere, but must fit several constraints. Prizes should not just be money, a good prize is something that interacts with the theme or sponsoring company, e.g tickets to WWDC for a HackNight sponsored by Apple. Participants vying for a prize must present the technical specifications of their hacks and not just the functionality of their creation (must disclose APIs/significant codebases used). Winners can either be chosen by consensus of the attendees or by the sponsors given some criteria determined by the HackNight Organizers.\nSponsors\nSponsors of HackNights should not be sponsors of HackIllinois and vice versa unless there is a clear benefit for all three parties (e.g RedHat may want to do a security HackNight leading up to HackIllinois as part of their sponsorship). Many traditional HackIllinois sponsors will not be a fit for the FOSS version and HackNights is an excellent  way to maintain that corporate relationship. There will be some sponsors who prefer one over the other (HackIllinois vs HackNights and vice versa). As such, a good price must be established which does not overcompete with HackIllinois and would generate income for HackIllinois but is not too high to scare sponsors off. Part of the deal should be the requirement that actual engineers be present at the hackathon, as there is little to gain for hackers otherwise. As a sidenote, sponsors should also be companies that hackers would like to interact with and are well regarded within the community; the sponsoring company should be part of the attraction.\nIntegration with HackIllinois and IlliniHackers\nHackNights is quite obviously the training ground for HackIllinois and also how we maintain the IlliniHackers community throughout the year. It might be interesting to explore HackNights as events which build up to HackIllinois in some way. This is ultimately up to the directors of HackIllinois, the Hacker Rep and HackNights.\nNext Steps\nA theme needs to be decided on. Action points need to be drawn up. A sponsorship doc needs to be created that that presents HackIllinois as the Free and Open Source hackathon, lays out the benefits and established what we seek in a sponsor. The sponsorship game plan should include a place for HackNights, whether it is recommended  to companies that don’t match the Open Source profile or as an additional benefit. Outreach for mentors from Open Source groups and sponsors needs to be executed this summer. A summer budget must be established so Experience can start to plan and execute fast. Outreach for HackNights must explicitly start this summer as well and HackNights should be starting to set up for the first HackNight (being held 3-4 weeks into the semester). Systems work should be aware of OpenHackathon and start to work within that context. The fate of IlliniHackers needs to be determined (basically getting control of the FB Page) and a representative for the hackers needs to be chosen. He or she needs to develop a game plan to formalize the organization from the hackers side and prepare for the general meeting at the beginning of the year. This means setting up scholarships, determining how hardware checkout works, and executing on other ideas that come up organically.

As Nest branched out into other products\nlike smoke detectors and cameras, it started to think about how all these devices would work together.\n\nNest developed the Thread protocol which is like the low power, IoT version of WiFi. The idea is that\nyou don't want these devices to clog up the WiFi network and consume a lot of power doing so and instead\ncould run on a separate network which specializes in low energy operation. Also unlike WiFi, Thread\nis mesh based, it creates a spanning tree across all devices and uses some devices to route to others.\nThis ensures that there is a stable connection for each IoT device. Nest wanted to center as much of the\ninformation and decision making inside the Thread network as possible, instead of relying on a bunch of\ncloud services needed to interact on your devices behalf. So they developed an application layer protocol\nfor Thread called Weave.\n\nThe role of Weave is to be the layer that allows structured information like requests for the current temperature\nor the status of the smoke alarm can be transmitted. This is all done within the \"Home Area Network\" (HAN). The\nissue is it becomes pretty complicated and time consuming to build complex features when you need to worry about\nnot just the device and Weave implementation but also the cloud services side to handle updates and remote access\nand the UI on smart phones and the web.\nWeave Schema Description Language\nMy internship work was to help address this problem. My team built into Weave a formalization of devices, called a device\nschema. This is the data model for the device.\n\n\"\nThe schema defines three elements:\n\nTraits: A unit of basic capability, such as the state of a property, a notification of the state, or a request to change the state\nInterfaces:  A group of traits that represent a specific function, such as the properties and events that make up a deadbolt lock\nResources: A logical or physical thing comprised of traits and interfaces, such as a Nest device, a structure, or a user\n\"\n\n\nSo a user can define a light which has the trait whether its on or off, and an interface which is a command to turn it on or off and the light itself is the resource.\nWe define this formalism using the Weave Schema Description Language, a DSL which gives us a structured artifact that describes a device.\nHere is an example schema of an interface that implements a door lock:\n/*\n *\n *    Copyright (c) 2019 Google LLC.\n *    Copyright (c) 2016-2018 Nest Labs, Inc.\n *    All rights reserved.\n *\n *    Licensed

Finally, the compiler can also\ngenerate the Swift and Java code to hook the interfaces defined in the schema to UIs in a mobile app. For Nest this means\nthat for any device they create or a partner creates they just need to have the Weave Schema and the actual device to\nfully integrate a new device into the Weave Network and show up in the Nest App. No frontend, or cloud development needed.\nThis lets developers focus on the device itself and less on the infrastructure.\nTo show off my work, I created a couple Weave devices on\ntop of Nest's internal development platform. This device simulated a door lock, turning an LED on and off when the user tries to unlock or lock the device.\nI by myself was able to write the embedded code, and stand up a full end to end smart lock service integrated into the existing\nNest app in less than a week.\nWeave is a strong choice for the protocol that will truly unify IoT ecosystems. Weave has the potential not just to make device\nimplementation easy but also could allow developers to make virtual devices. Developers could say describe an intercom system which in\nmight use a microphone and speakers. You could setup a weave device schema which says for the intercom interface you need a microphone trait and\nmultiple speaker traits. Then some physical device could query the HAN to find some devices that have a speaker trait or a mic trait then recruit them\nto come together in this new intercom virtual device. So you could use the microphone on a Nest Cam and the speakers in Nest smoke detectors and\nnow have an in house intercom system without needed to buy any new hardware.\nNest was and Google is now committed to opening up weave to all sorts of developers by open sourcing Weave, WDL and the WDL compiler. Nest also open sourced Thread.\nThread has been adopted by companies like Eero / Amazon and Apple so maybe OpenWeave will come next.\n\n\nWDL Compiler: https://github.com/openweave/openweave-wdlc\nOpenWeave: https://github.com/openweave\nOpenThread: https://github.com/openthread\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/open-weave/","title":"Weave DSL - A DSL for IoT Device specification"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/peter-pan/":{"body":"\nThis work was done during the Greylock Hackfest 2016\n\nWe entered the 2016 Greylock Hackfest and for the first couple hours didn't know what to work on. We\nactually left Facebook HQ where the hackathon was being held to make a run to Fry's to see what hardware they had available.\nDuring this time not having an idea we were browsing Facebook and one of us remarked on how bad the image compression was.\nThere was noticable artifiacting all over the image. We got to thinking, what we really cared about in the image was\nthe subject, our friends in this case. The background itself can take the majority of the pixels but ultimately is\nmuch less important. I had been doing research in computer vision for the last couple years and so was starting to\nhear a lot about neural networks and their applications. One application is segmentation, being able to seperate out\ndifferent objects in an image pixelwise. So we thought well this is an easy way to find the subject of an image. What\nif we created a new image compression format where we keep the subject of the image at full resolution but significantly\ncompress the background? We called our project Peter Pan, a reference to Pied Piper from Silicon Valley who created their\nown fictional compression scheme.\n\nHow compression works\nLossy vs. Lossless\nThere's two ways to approach compression. One is to find a compressed representation that completely encode the source data without\nlosing any information. This is important for mediums like text or binaries where potentially a single bit flip will break you program.\nThis is called lossless compression.\nFor mediums where its hard to tell between the original and very good imitations there methods which willing accept that some data\nwill be modified from the original source since they expect people will not be able to tell the difference anyway. This is called lossy compression.\nIt's common to use lossy compression for audio, video and photos to save a significant amount of space on disk.\nHuman centered compression\nSome components of an image are more important than others. We as people care more\nabout the details in the subject than the details in the background in the general\n(there are cases like landscape photography where we do care more about the background).\nHence instead of uniformly compressing the entire image, it may be worth while to\ncompress the background significantly in some lossy way while essentially maintaining the\nfull resolution of the subject of the image. This also leverages the fact that typically\nthe background is out of focus and so minor discrepancies are harder to detect. This is almost a hybrid approach\nof lossy and lossless compression and allows us to use our bits more wisely.\nSystem Architecture\nAs this work was done at a hackathon, we couldn't train some end to end system that from scratch learned human preferences for\ncompression. Instead we leverage the work done in semantic segmentation using a pretrained model from the Oxford Vision Group. We create\nsegmentation masks for each subject in the image and separate the subject pixels from\nthe background pixels. Then we losslessly compress the subject pixels and we downsample (as a cheap\nform of lossy compression) the background. This now represents the compressed form of the\nimage and can be transmitted. We then transfer the compressed image, upsample the background and\noverlay the subjects.\nPerformance\nWe did a short performance analysis against the inspiration for this project which is Facebook's\nimage compression scheme, which notoriously creates noisy images after compression.\nWe see that for the subjects comparing the full resolution image to the image produced after compression that as you'd expect the discrepancies are only in the background and harder to notice.\nFor Facebook the differences are spread uniformly and therefore there is a lot of artifacting in the\nsubject of the image. From a quick visual inspect we see better images from our approach than Facebook's.\nSize wise we are on the order of magnitude of 2-3x smaller package size than the image you download from Facebook.\nExample\nHere is an example photo of a couple of our friends:\n\n\nOriginal image\n\n\n\nHere is the segmentation mask for the semantically important subjects in the photo. Notice that it also picks up the person in the background out of focus.\nThough he is out of focus, it is still important to preserve detail in that component of the image because people will focus on it after moving from the primary subject\n\n\n\nPeter Pan compressed image. Notice that all detail in the two people in the image has been preserved while there is slight visual artifacting in the background\n\n\n\nFacebook compressed image. Notice the uniform artifacting, both subject and background are treated the same making artifacting more noticeable\n\nLimitations\nYou can see in the Peter Pan image that borders between the subject and the background are quite abrupt. This is mostly a result of the time constraint for a hackathon but\nrunning a smoothing pass over the borders would help to make a more cohesive image. This format also has significant edge cases. If the subject takes up the majority of the image then size savings will be limited. The size of the image is now correlated with the semantic content of the image and no longer the size and image entropy. This would make it harder to deploy in a setting like Facebooks.\nYou can find the source code for Peter Pan here\n\nhttps://github.com/narendasan/peter-pan\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/peter-pan/","title":"Peter Pan: Semantic Image Compression"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/pokemon-clip/":{"body":"Building CLIP from Scratch to Classify Pokemon\nPrior deep learning approaches to performing image classification frame the problem as given a\ndataset of image, label pairs, learn a mapping between the image space and the label space using\na neural network (MLP, CNN, etc.). Here the image space is typically a CxHxW dimensional space\nwhere C is the number of channels, H and W are the height and width of the input image. Labels\nmay have semantic meaning to us as humans, but are presented to the model simply as one-hot\nencoded vectors in a fixed sized N-D space where N is the number of possible different labels\nthat can be seen in the dataset. Each dimension of the label space is assigned a distinct\npossible label, and the models output in that any particular dimension represents the models\nconfidence that the image is of that class. Extremely good performance on classification tasks\ncan be achieved using this problem framing and a good choice of model architecture. However,\nthis framing has drawbacks when trying to move out of narrow independent and identically\ndistributed settings, such as classification of images that are of a class not seen before\nor dealing with slightly differently formed labels. In such cases, the model is unaware of\nthe existence of anything other than the N classes it was designed to decide between. Even\nif it was, it would not be able to represent a novel class due to its fixed sized output and\nthe assigned semantic meanings to each dimension.\nMore recently, self-supervised methods have emerged which use simple scalable training tasks\nto create models that can easily be repurposed for a number of different tasks. Many of these\nmethods avoid the use fixed sized label spaces instead looking to embed representations of\ndifferent modalities of data in a common embedding space. Distance in this embedding space\nrepresents “sameness”. These models look to therefore project tuples of related data into the\nsame area in embedding space. Unseen labels or classes can be projected into this embedding\nspace just as easily as seen data, so even if the model has not seen that exact label before,\nit its embedding should be close to similar seen labels and consequently their corresponding images.\nOne of these methods is Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). CLIP looks to take image\nand text pairs such as captions for an image or alt-text and estimate how related they are by\nthis projection into a common embedding space. As opposed to “traditional” classification approaches,\nCLIP is not attempting to solve the classification problem directly. It instead looks to maximize\nthe cosine similarity between correct image text pairs in the joint embedding space and minimize\nthe similarity between incorrect pairs. CLIP can then be repurposed for classification by giving\nthe model the choice between a number of potential captions (or labels) for an unseen image. The\ncaption with the highest cosine similarity can be considered the class, leading to what is known\n“open world” object recognition. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create our own CLIP model\nand use it to classify images of Pokemon.\nThe CLIP Model\nThe CLIP model consists of a text encoder and an image encoder. Since the ultimate goal is to be\nable pair image embeddings with their corresponding text embeddings, these two models are trained\ntogether to maximize the pairwise cosine similarities between corresponding image and text embeddings\nand conversely minimize the cosine similarity between image and text embeddings from different pairs.\nclass CLIP(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, emb_dim, vit_width, img_size, patch_size, n_channels, vit_layers, vit_heads, vocab_size, text_width, max_seq_length, text_heads, text_layers):\n        super().__init__()\n\n        self.image_encoder = ImageEncoder(vit_width, img_size, patch_size, n_channels, vit_layers, vit_heads, emb_dim)\n\n        self.text_encoder = TextEncoder(vocab_size, text_width, max_seq_length, text_heads, text_layers, emb_dim)\n\n        self.temperature = nn.Parameter(torch.ones([]) * np.log(1 / 0.07))\n\n        self.device = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n\n\n    def forward(self,image,text, mask=None):\n        I_e = self.image_encoder(image)\n        T_e = self.text_encoder(text, mask=mask)\n\n        # scaled pairwise cosine similarities [n, n]\n        logits = (I_e @ T_e.transpose(-2,-1)) * torch.exp(self.temperature)\n\n        # symmetric loss function\n        labels = torch.arange(logits.shape[0]).to(self.device)\n\n        loss_i = nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits.transpose(-2,-1), labels)\n        loss_t = nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits, labels)\n\n        loss = (loss_i + loss_t) / 2\n\n        return loss\n\nIf you don’t know what text or image encoders are, you might want to follow a more bottom-up CLIP\ntutorial that first develops these concepts: https://medium.com/correll-lab/building-clip-from-scratch-68f6e42d35f4\nText Encoder\nFor the text encoder in CLIP we use the standard transformer architecture. However we want to embed\nfeatures in the joint vision-text embedding space. Therefore we have an extra set of parameters\nnn.Parameter(torch.randn(width, emb_dim)).

Similar to the text encoder,\nwe have an extra set of parameters nn.Parameter(torch.randn(width, emb_dim)), the forward function\nwill embed the image features in the joint embedding space by taking the dot product of the features\nand the learned projection divided by the normalized dot product.\nclass ImageEncoder(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, width, img_size, patch_size, n_channels, n_layers, n_heads, emb_dim):\n        super().__init__()\n\n        assert img_size[0] % patch_size[0] == 0 and img_size[1] % patch_size[1] == 0, \"img_size dimensions must be divisible by patch_size dimensions\"\n        assert width % n_heads == 0, \"width must be divisible by n_heads\"\n\n        self.n_patches = (img_size[0] * img_size[1]) // (patch_size[0] * patch_size[1])\n\n        self.max_seq_length = self.n_patches + 1\n\n        # Patch Embedding\n        self.linear_project = nn.Conv2d(n_channels, width, kernel_size=patch_size, stride=patch_size)\n\n        # Classification Token\n        self.cls_token = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, 1, width))\n\n        self.positional_embedding = PositionalEmbedding(width,self.max_seq_length)\n\n        self.encoder = nn.ModuleList([TransformerEncoder(width,n_heads) for _ in range(n_layers)])\n\n        # learned proj of image to embed\n        self.projection = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(width, emb_dim))\n\n\n    def forward(self,x):\n        # Patch Embedding\n        x = self.linear_project(x)\n        x = x.flatten(2).transpose(1, 2)\n\n        # Positional Embedding\n        x = torch.cat((self.cls_token.expand(x.size()[0], -1, -1),x), dim=1)\n        x = self.positional_embedding(x)\n\n        # Transformer Encoder\n        for encoder_layer in self.encoder:\n            x = encoder_layer(x)\n\n        # Takes Class Tokens\n        x = x[:, 0, :]\n\n        # joint multimodal embedding\n        if self.projection is not None:\n            x = x @ self.projection\n\n        x = x / torch.norm(x, dim=-1, keepdim=True)\n\n        return x\n\nTraining\n\nThe training process consists of providing image, caption pairs from the dataset. CLIP uses contrastive\nloss to train the model. Since we are looking to maximize the scaled pairwise cosine similarities\nbetween the image and text embeddings along the diagonal where the text and image embeddings are correctly\npaired, we can use cross entropy loss across the rows and columns with psuedo-labels corresponding to the\nindex of the embedding. This is the same as evaluating $n$ distinct text -&gt; image estimates\nand $n$ image -&gt; text estimates concurrently. The model loss is the mean loss between the text and\nimage cross entropy loss.\nlabels = torch.arange(logits.shape[0]).to(self.device)\n# Label for row/column i is i (i.e. the index of the correct other half of the pair)\n\nloss_i = nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits.transpose(-2,-1), labels)\nloss_t = nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits, labels)\n\nloss = (loss_i + loss_t) / 2\n\nDataset\nFor this tutorial we will use Faith Aykon's\nMini-Pokemon dataset, hosted on HuggingFace\n(this requires datasets==2.21.0).\nThis dataset consists of 280 examples in a 210/70 train/test split. The full dataset has 7000 images but as\nsuch takes much longer to train, though the code can be trivially modified to use the full dataset\nWe will perform a number of modifications to this dataset to make it more suitable to training for CLIP.\nfrom torchvision.transforms import v2\nclass Pokemon(Dataset):\n    def __init__(self, train=True):\n\n        # Download the dataset from HuggingFace, use the mini split (change \"mini\" to \"full\" for the full dataset)\n        self.dataset = load_dataset(\"fcakyon/pokemon-classification\", \"mini\", trust_remote_code=True)\n\n        # Image preprocessing\n        self.transform = v2.Compose([\n            v2.Resize((128, 128)),\n            v2.ToTensor()\n        ])\n\n        if train:\n            self.split = \"train\"\n        else:\n            self.split = \"test\"\n\n\n        self.label_names = self.dataset[self.split].features[\"labels\"].names\n\n        self.caption_options = [\"An image of {0}\",\n                                \"A {0}\",\n                                \"A photo of {0}\",\n                                \"A {0} in a photo\",\n                                \"A picture of {0}\",\n                                \"A {0} image\"]\n\n        self.captions = {\n            i: f\"An image of a {l}\" for i, l in enumerate(self.label_names)\n        }\n        self.labels = {\n            i : l for i,l in enumerate(self.label_names)\n        }\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        return self.dataset.num_rows[self.split]\n\n    def __getitem__(self,i):\n        img = self.dataset[self.split][i][\"image\"]\n        img = self.transform(img)\n\n        caption_template = np.random.choice(self.caption_options)\n        caption_text = caption_template.format(self.labels[self.dataset[self.split][i][\"labels\"]])\n        cap, mask = tokenizer(caption_text)\n\n        mask = mask.repeat(len(mask),1)\n\n        return {\"image\": img, \"caption\": cap, \"mask\": mask, \"text\": caption_text, \"label\": self.dataset[self.split][i][\"labels\"]}\n\nImage Preprocessing\nWe define a transformation pipeline which gets applied to each image using\nself.transform = v2.Compose([\n    v2.Resize((128, 128)),\n    v2.ToTensor()\n])\n\nThere is not too much data augmentation needed for simple cases, therefore we just resize the input image to a reasonable size.\nText Preprocessing\nThe original dataset is set up for more traditional classification approaches, i.e. some class label for each image which is an int\nrepresenting the index of the 1 in a one-hot encoded form of the label. Since CLIP uses text and not one-hot encoded vectors for the\n“labels”, we need to generate them. The critical information is the type of Pokemon in the image. However, there are many ways in\nnatural language to convey the same information and we want to be robust to phrasing as it will help our classifier be more\nrobust later on.\nTherefore, we include a number of caption templates that phrase the label in many semantically similar ways. When retrieving\na new image, a label pair is pulled from the dataset, this code will choose one of the caption templates to create a caption\ncontaining the label text.\nclass Pokemon():\n  def __init(self, ...):\n    ...\n    self.caption_options = [\"An image of {0}\",\n                            \"A {0}\",\n                            \"A photo of {0}\",\n                            \"A {0} in a photo\",\n                            \"A picture of {0}\",\n                            \"A {0} image\"]\n\n  def __getitem__(self, i):\n    ...\n    caption_template = rng.choice(self.caption_options)\n    caption_text = caption_template.format(self.labels[self.dataset[self.split][i][\"labels\"]])\n\n\nTokenization\n\nTransformer models do not work directly on text, instead they use a numerical representation of characters (tokens). In this example\nwe use a trivial tokenization scheme UTF-8.\nWith the UTF-8 encoding the max vocabulary size is 256 since we are direct mapping from characters. For larger desired context sizes,\nother tokenization schemes with greater vocabulary sizes may be desired.\nThe tokenizer delimits the input string with start and end tokens, reserved values that denote the limits of the input. Since the\ninput to the transformer is fixed size, the input tensor is padded to the full width of the input. Finally a mask is created to denote\nthat padded inputs should be ignored.\ndef tokenizer(text, encode=True, mask=None, max_seq_length=32):\n    if encode:\n        out = chr(2) + text + chr(3) # Adding SOT and EOT tokens\n        out = out + \"\".join([chr(0) for _ in range(max_seq_length-len(out))]) # Adding Padding\n        out = torch.IntTensor(list(out.encode(\"utf-8\"))) # Encoding Text\n        mask = torch.ones(len(out.nonzero()))\n        mask = torch.cat((mask,torch.zeros(max_seq_length-len(mask)))).type(torch.IntTensor)\n    else:\n        out = [chr(x) for x in text[1:len(mask.nonzero())-1]]\n        out = \"\".join(out)\n        mask = None\n\n    return out, mask\n\nThese tokenzied forms of the captions are pre-calculated as part of the dataset.\ncap, mask = tokenizer(caption_text)\n\nSince the mask will be applied to the attention scores ($max_seq_len x max_seq_len$), it needs to be repeated to be applied to each row.\nmask = mask.repeat(len(mask),1)\n\nTherefore for each entry in the dataset we have the following information\n{\"image\": img, \"caption\": cap, \"mask\": mask, \"text\": caption_text, \"label\": self.dataset[self.split][i][\"labels\"]}\n\nExample\n\nimage.shape: torch.Size([3, 128, 128])\ncaption.shape: torch.Size([32])\nmask.shape: torch.Size([32, 32])\ntext: \"A Alakazam image\"\ncaption(tokenized): tensor([ 2, 65, 32, 112, 104, 111, 116, 111, 32, 111, 102, 32, 65, 108,\n97, 107, 97, 122, 97, 109, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=torch.int32)\nmask: tensor([[1, 1, 1, …, 0, 0, 0],\n[1, 1, 1, …, 0, 0, 0],\n[1, 1, 1, …, 0, 0, 0],\n…,\n[1, 1, 1, …, 0, 0, 0],\n[1, 1, 1, …, 0, 0, 0],\n[1, 1, 1, …, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=torch.int32)\n\nHyperparameters\nThese are the parameters I used for training on a 3080Ti.

We start by creating a spanning set of captions\nfor the different possible labels using one a slightly different caption form from those seen in training (ex. ”An\nimage of a Pikachu”). This was actually done as part of the dataset construction:\nself.captions = {\n  i: f\"An image of a {l}\" for i, l in enumerate(self.label_names)\n}\n\nEach of these potential captions is tokenzied using the tokenizer and fed to the text encoder and a batch of images from the\ntest set are fed into the image encoder.\nWe then calculate the cosine similarity between the text and image embeddings and run softmax to get probabilities that any\nparticular label is the best pairing for a particular image.\nWe can then match these predicted captions with the true label to determine if the model was correct or not.\n# Loading Best Model\nmodel = CLIP(emb_dim, vit_width, img_size, patch_size, n_channels, vit_layers, vit_heads, vocab_size, text_width, max_seq_length, text_heads, text_layers).to(device)\nmodel.load_state_dict(torch.load(\"clip_pokemon4.pt\", map_location=device))\n\n# Getting dataset captions to compare images to\ntext = torch.stack([tokenizer(x)[0] for x in test_set.captions.values()]).to(device)\nmask = torch.stack([tokenizer(x)[1] for x in test_set.captions.values()])\nmask = mask.repeat(1,len(mask[0])).reshape(len(mask),len(mask[0]),len(mask[0])).to(device)\n\ncorrect, total = 0,0\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    for data in test_loader:\n        images, labels  = data[\"image\"].to(device), data[\"label\"].to(device)\n        image_features = model.image_encoder(images)\n        text_features = model.text_encoder(text, mask=mask)\n\n        image_features /= image_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\n        text_features /= text_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\n        similarity = (100.0 * (image_features @ text_features.T)).softmax(dim=-1)\n        _, indices = torch.max(similarity,1)\n\n        correct += torch.sum(indices==labels)\n        total += len(labels)\n\nprint(f'\\nModel Accuracy: {100 * correct // total} %')\n\nUsing my training settings and seed, I was able to achieve 87% accuracy on the Pokemon-mini dataset. This is not really representative for C\nLIP’s power, as the dataset we have used for training here is very small. Using a CNN would actually be the preferred approach\nhere. Yet, for very large datasets CLIP has outperformed previous CNN model.\nZero-shot Classification\n\nWe can reuse our CLIP model to perform the classification task now. First we generate a list of possible labels. These will just be names of\ndifferent types of Pokemon found in the dataset (ex. ”Pikachu”). We then tokenize each potential label and feed them to the text encoder. We\nalso feed an unlabeled image to the image label. The CLIP model will return the similarities between each potential label and the image based\non the training it had seen before. Note that we never just provide the label alone as a text pairing during training, but we do provide\nvarious different captions which all share the label word within them. This demonstrates how, because of our pre-training, we are robust to\nunseen label forms and yet can correctly associate the image with the correct label.\n# Loading Best Model\nmodel = CLIP(emb_dim, vit_width, img_size, patch_size, n_channels, vit_layers, vit_heads, vocab_size, text_width, max_seq_length, text_heads, text_layers).to(device)\nmodel.load_state_dict(torch.load(\"clip_pokemon4.pt\", map_location=device))\n\n\n# Captions to compare images to\nclass_names = test_set.label_names\nclass_text = [f\"{l}\" for l in class_names]\n\ntext = torch.stack([tokenizer(x)[0] for x in class_text]).to(device)\nmask = torch.stack([tokenizer(x)[1] for x in class_text])\nmask = mask.repeat(1,len(mask[0])).reshape(len(mask),len(mask[0]),len(mask[0])).to(device)\n\nidx = 12\n\nimg = test_set[idx][\"image\"][None,:]\nplt.imshow(  img[0].permute(1, 2, 0),)\nplt.title(test_set[idx][\"text\"])\nplt.show()\nimg = img.to(device)\nwith torch.no_grad():\n  image_features = model.image_encoder(img)\n  text_features = model.text_encoder(text, mask=mask)\n\n\nimage_features /= image_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\ntext_features /= text_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\nsimilarity = (100.0 * image_features @ text_features.T).softmax(dim=-1)\nvalues, indices = similarity[0].topk(5)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"\\nTop predictions:\\n\")\nfor value, index in zip(values, indices):\n    print(f\"{class_names[int(index)]:&gt;16s}: {100 * value.item():.2f}%\")\n\nYou can find a notebook with the code from this tutorial here\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/pokemon-clip/","title":"Building CLIP from Scratch to Classify Pokemon"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/procgen-terrain/":{"body":"A Procedurally Generated Mountain Town\nI spent the fall learning about computer graphics and OpenGL, a topic which I didn't get to cover in my undergrad. OpenGL is now a 30 year old standard which is primarily written in C/C++. It is a nice way to start since a lot of the common components needed in a graphics stack are baked in. But its usage patterns and APIs are showing their age so I wanted to see what next generation tools like Rust and Vulkan can allow me to do and to see what the differences are between the two stacks.\n\nApproach\nVulkan is a new low level graphics API that is intended as the next generation OpenGL. OpenGL being created in 1992 was designed for very different hardware paradigms. Over the last 3 decades the architecture and roles of the graphics card, driver and APIs have changed and Vulkan is intended to address these changes.\nSimilarly, when OpenGL was created C and C++ were the primary languages used to develop graphics applications. While they remain to be wildly popular, a new generation of programing languages are reaching maturity. These languages offer many modern convinces not reflected in C/C++ programming like a language specific build system and package manager, modules, and many compiler features to catch errors. One of the most exciting next generation programming languages is Rust which is a C-Like low level systems programming language with guaranteed memory and thready safety. Features that are of particular interest in graphics programming.\nTo try these new tools out I implemented a procedurally generated scene, where the terrain is generated from perlin noise. I then place models of trees and houses on to the terrain, randomly placed.\nVulkan Pipeline Setup\nThere is a lot to do to setup a Vulkan Rendering Pipeline. In Rust there are a few choices for Vulkan API implementations. Some like ash are very lightweight and close to the original C++ implementation. However, these sort of APIs are \"unsafe\" meaning you lose many of the benefits of using Rust in terms of memory\nand thread safety in exchange for a very familiar interface. I chose vulkano. Vulkano is a \"Rusty\" implementation of Vulkan in that the coding paradigms used are native to Rust and it is fully compliant with \"safe\" Rust.\nTo actually set up a Vulkan renderer you need to construct all the parts of the OpenGL state machine which existed globally in OpenGL. This starts with the Vulkan Instance. The instance manages the version of the Vulkan spec we are using and any extensions to Vulkan we need to use. Window drawing is in fact not part of the core Vulkan spec, so this is one of the extensions we need to include.\nIn Rust the render loop is encapsulated in an EventLoop which defines enums for different events that can happen like key presses or window resizes. The actual render loop logic is defined in closure provided to the event loop.\nThe render image is called a surface. I actually use a different package winit to create this surface since its not a core part of Vulkan.\nNext, we need to set up the device to render on. This starts by defining the set of extensions our device needs to support. All we need is a device that supports swapchains so we can draw onto the surface. Then we need to find a compatible device. Vulkano lets you list all available Vulkan capable devices (including software based Vulkan devices) and query if they support the necessary extensions. In my code there is logic to prefer the dGPU over the iGPU in the case there both.\nAfter selecting the physical device (in my case my RTX 3050Ti) we need to create a Vulkan device. We base it off the physical device selected and provide a list of the features we need to have support for. In this case just swapchain support is needed. As a result of this process, queues are creates as well. Vulkan can support multiple queues but I only use one.\nNext we actually create the swapchain which manages the image buffers. Swapchains allow you to construct the next frame while the current frame is being shown. The swap chain buffer size is window size dependent so the swap chain must be recreated if the window is resized.\nWe then create the render pass. Vulkan lets you have more than one render pass which can be used to apply multiple sets of vertex and fragment shaders. This is useful to isolate effects like lighting in their own passes. Passes can also multiple sub passes. In my application I only use a single pass similar to OpenGL code. The render pass defines as well the where the output of the graphics pipeline will go, the layout of the images and where the depth, color and stencil information will go.\nFrom there we create the graphics pipeline. This is similar to the OpenGL program but contained and it provides more control. You provide the pipeline builder the layout of your input. the input shader, the format of the buffer, the viewport, the fragment shader and the render pass. This part is where Rust starts the shine. Macros in Rust are much more powerful than in C/C++. They let you execute code at compile time as well as create new code. This lets you do all sorts of powerful things. For example I can write my shaders and provide them to a rust macro. This macro can compile my shader at compile time and create a rust struct which corresponds to the input layout of my shader. This means I can set uniform buffers by just setting fields in a struct. I can also use another macro which takes my definition of a vertex and automatically structures the buffer to interface properly with my shader. Therefore I can just provide a vector of vertex structs and have Rust generate the code to lay it out. The compile will also throw errors if you improperly populate the buffers.\nThe last step is to allocate the framebuffers for the swapchain. We launch the event loop to start the rendering.\nThe closure in the event loop defines the render logic. Rust enforces that all cases be handled, so you need to define a way to handle each event. Most will fall into a default case. In this default case, the first thing to do is clean the last frame so that memory does not leak. Then it is important to check if the swap chain needs to be rebuilt. This can be due to the window being resized or Vulkan can tell you when the swapchain is not optimal.\nThe next step is to get the next framebuffer we can draw on which we clear. From this point the pipeline is similar to OpenGL. You carry out a series of draw commands to render components of the scene. However in Vulkano this is done via a command builder. The command builder allows you to sequence a list of operations to run during the render pass. This is where pipelines and vertex buffers are bound and draw commands are issued. Once the pass is closed the command is built and then executed returning a \"Future\". Futures are a placeholder of something to happen in the future. It lets the main program continue executing and checking later for a result. This future will tell the program if the frame rendered successfully.\nScene Pipeline\n\n\nThe graphics pipeline to generate terrain and then place models\n\nWhen the application starts the user can provide the following settings:\nprocgen-terrain 0.1.0\n\nUSAGE:\n    procgen-terrain.exe [OPTIONS]\n\nFLAGS:\n        --help       Prints help information\n    -V, --version    Prints version information\n\nOPTIONS:\n    -b, --bounds &lt;bounds&gt;         [default: 30]\n    -g, --gridsize &lt;gridsize&gt;     [default: 256]\n    -h, --houses &lt;houses&gt;         [default: 10]\n    -m, --map &lt;map&gt;               [default: 128.0]\n    -n, --noise &lt;noise&gt;           [default: 512]\n    -s, --seed &lt;seed&gt;             [default: 100]\n    -t, --trees &lt;trees&gt;           [default: 200]\n\n\nnoise: Control the size of the noise map ($N \\times N$) that is generated. This allows you to control the resolution of the noise\nmap: Size ($M \\times M$) of the terrain mesh generated in world coordinates\ngridsize: The resolution ($G \\times G$) of the terrain mesh. Higher numbers mean more vertices in the mesh\nseed: The seed for the noise generator. Giving the same seed generates the same noise map\nbounds: The distance from the center that modeled geometry can spawn. Prevents unnecessary rendering for models that can't be seen\ntrees: Number of trees to spawn. Trees are spawned in random positions on the terrain within the bounds\nhouses: Number of houses to spawn. Like trees houses are spawned in random positions within the bounds\n\nUsing the noise seed, a perlin noise map is generated. A flat surface of $S \\times S$ vertices is created spanning the space $M \\times M$ in world coordinates. Using the noise map the intensity of a pixel in the map is used to set the $y$ coordinate by mapping each vertex from grid space into the dimensions of the noise map. Now the geometry of the terrain is set. In order to set the colors, bands of elevation are mapped to each material (Grass, Rock, Snow). At this point the terrain is complete. At the terrain creation stage, a $G \\times G \\times 3$ elevation map is created which stores the position of each vertex for later.\nThe bounds argument defines a $B \\times B$ area in the scene centered on the origin where models can be rendered. This is done since far off parts of the terrain mesh will never have enough resolution to see the models. The scene pipeline samples $T$ locations for trees and $H$ locations for houses without replacement. The geometry and textures for the tree model and house models are loaded and initially scaled. Only one copy of the tree and house geometry are on the GPU but $T$ and $H$ copies of the model matrix are created to define the transformation for each tree to be rendered. Using the sampled locations to index the elevation map to get the $xyz$ position of the vertex that the model will be rendered on. The model is then translated to that position which makes it seem like the model is rendered on the surface of the terrain. During draw calls only the model matrix is changed between models, the model vertices never change.\nRust/Vulkan vs C++/OpenGL\nThe performance of Vulkan\nI profiled my application using NVIDIA NSight Graphics which can profile both the CPU and GPU usage as well as the latency for each draw call and bottlenecks in shader execution.\nIn my profiling I found there is negligible CPU overhead once rendering begins on the order of &lt; 0.1 ms. Since this was a design goal of Vulkan in improving over OpenGL and its heavy driver this is cool to see.\nUsing default settings I found that the terrain draw call took 9.41ms to draw. Default settings produce a 393216 vertex terrain model and is by far the most complex piece of geometry in the scene. The tree and house models each take 0.2ms and 0.1ms respectively per model to draw. They are 930 and 534 vertex models respectively.\nWith default settings I get a frame rate of on average 64 FPS on an RTX 3050 Ti. There are 211 draw calls per render pass. I also found that the frame rate fluctuates due to the complexity of the terrain in frame more an any number of models that get spawned.\n\nIn profiling the terrain rendering system you see linear scaling in the time to render the terrain model with the number of vertices in th the model which is to be expected.\n\nIn the measure of the impact of the number of models in the scene I found initially, up to 500, there is not a huge impact in frame times, the long pole is the terrain rendering. but there is a cross over point around 600 trees where the number of models becomes the main contributor to additional frame latency.\nPerformance Improvements\nI currently only keep one copy of the models, Terrain, Tree and House on the GPU and just swap out the uniform buffers for the draw calls. I could try to find a way to reduce the upload time, maybe through pipelining or a swap buffer. This would reduce GPU memory bandwidth consumption and latency. I think that rendering gets held up on terrain for reasonable amounts of models. One of the new things Vulkan enables is multi-threaded rendering. So while the terrain is being drawn, I can draw the other geometry. Rust is also known for its thread safety so this seems like a good pair.\nHow Vulkan and Rust compare to OpenGL and C++\nThere are stark differences between Vulkan and OpenGL. Vulkan gives you control over everything. This is both good and bad. The good is that you fully understand all aspects of the system and can customize it to the exact render architecture you would like. The bad is that there is a lot of set up. Vulkan also is not a \"batteries included\" Graphics API. Functionality other stacks deem core like windowing are extensions in Vulkan. Vulkan also still has some confusing and incomplete support in the ecosystem as it is still pretty new. Sometimes you get odd features being reported as unsupported.\nAll this being said, I think the way to look at Vulkan in contrast to OpenGL is that OpenGL is a framework for graphics applications. The majority of the effort is in formatting your data in a way that is consumable by OpenGL. Vulkan is a toolkit. The expectation is that you use the components in Vulkan to create something tuned to your specific application. You have direct control of the state of the graphics pipeline vs. managing a global state machine and all state modifications are in a self contained environment allowing you to manage more than one. This also enables multi-threaded rendering. Overall, this means you need to spend the time up front setting up a renderer but you can make sure that it fits the data you have ideally.\nVulkan is also more lightweight and has much better performance than OpenGL which is a clear decision maker in graphics. It allows you finer tuned control of the memory management to make resource management more efficient. Multi-threading is possible and commands take less time with less CPU overhead.\nI also think that a strong positive or Vulkan is just that it is modern. OpenGL being written in the 90s lacks the last 20 years of evolution in programming paradigms. Functional programming, closures, advanced compiler support, types, descriptive error messaging and more are nonexistent in OpenGL where as in Vulkan through Vulkano, all these concepts are included and leveraged to help you develop applications.\nThis leads into the benefits of Rust. Where as I would be more tempered in my recommendation of Vulkan as a tool to use if you know what you want. I 100% recommend Rust over C++. The developer velocity during this project in contrast to the previous assignments is an order of magnitude greater. It is much easier to leverage the community who have put work into mesh file loaders, noise generators, ndarray implementations and graphics math libraries. Code is portable out of the box with little to no setup. It took me 5 mins on Windows to setup an environment to build the project which I built in Linux and it worked on the first try.\nThe community work and tooling alone is a strong enough reason to use Rust. But really what sets it apart are the language features and compiler. Macros in Rust remove 90% of boilerplate code. They let you generate linkages between shaders, CPUAccessibleBuffers and Structs in 5 lines of code, not to mention auto derived print formatting for debugging and copy constructors. Rust as a through its syntax gives you the freedom to solve problems in the way that feels most natural. In some cases functional map, filter, reduce pipelines make a lot of sense, like processing a lot of vertices in a vector. Other times for loops make sense. Tagged enums make it easy to encode information and create state machines which get enforced by the compiler. The intelligence of the compiler, the rules the language imposes and how strictly they are enforced also means that you get the performance of C with the memory safety of Java. If your code compiles, likely it will work in a safe manner. You pay the cost in terms of time to get code compiling but you spend far less time battling runtime bugs which are far harder to debug. The biggest concern of many beginning Rust programmers, the borrow checker gets addressed by Rust's wonderful compiler which unlike GCC not only provides relevant error messages but also suggests useful solutions. Many times the only thing needed to solve the borrow checker is just paste in the code that the compiler tells you to.\nThere are drawbacks for Rust though that I found. The main one is that there are 10 different alpha stability solutions for each problem which do 80% of what you need. Each dependency uses a different approach. So in my application I have 3 different glm like libraries which are good at slightly different things. This is just due to the ecosystem not solidifying common solutions like Python did with NumPy or PyTorch. I believe this is just a matter of time.\nOverall, I had a really positive experience switching from OpenGL and C++ to Vulkan and Rust. I think that Vulkan is a little too low level for most small hobbyist scale projects but as soon as you move to build a real world system it is the clear choice. I think that there is space for something to provide a batteries included version of Vulkan. In Rust, the wgpu project might be this solution. I think that Rust on the otherhand enables developers to do more faster and provided the foundational dependencies needed for a project exist, there are very few reasons to use C/C++ over Rust.\nYou can find the implementation of this pipeline at: https://github.com/narendasan/procgen-terrain\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/procgen-terrain/","title":"procgen-terrain: A Procedurally Generated Mountain Town"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/tedxmilehigh/":{"body":"I gave a TEDx Talk on my work at NOAA on climate modeling, CU on swarm robotics and Design and Developement work for my High School\nand how you can use design thinking as a framework to approach for interdisiplinary studies.\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/tedxmilehigh/","title":"Learning for an Interdisciplinary World"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/tensorrt-python-api/":{"body":"When one thinks of neural networks, probably the first thing they think of is a deep learning framework like Tensorflow or PyTorch. The creation of deep learning frameworks were crucial to the adoption of deep learning in the products we use every day. Instead of having to write your own CUDA kernels to leverage the parallelization power of a GPU, you can easily structure components together into a graph and managed the training of that graph all in python, letting the frameworks handle all the hard parts. But this is only half of the solution to making deep learning a viable tool to do useful work.\nOnce the weights have been finalized and the training completed you are left with something that while may be good at its particular task, is far less efficient than it could be. Many people when deploying neural network models, take the extra step to optimize their model before deploying it so as to get the maximum throughput through the network. There are a couple projects that look to be the Tensorflow or PyTorch of this deployment phase (also known as the inference phase). Those include Facebook's GLOW compiler, DLVM, ONNC, nGraph, TVM and XLA. NVIDIA creates one specifically for optimizing networks on their GPUs for inference called TensorRT. If you want to know more about the optimizations that TensorRT does, take a look at these blog posts: https://devblogs.nvidia.com/tag/tensorrt/.\nIn January of 2017 when I joined NVIDIA for a 8 month co-op, TensorRT 2.1 just came out. At the time for a user to optimize a network they had a couple of options, all of which required setting up a large C++ infrastructure around the model ingest.\nAt the time the only supported \"parser\" was for Caffe Models, and everyone else would have to manually extract weights and read them into a network definition API. Here was a minimal example from around then:\nThe user would start by creating an ingest system that would take a Caffe model, parse it then create an engine.\nTensorRT Engine Builder\nIBuilder* builder = createInferBuilder(gLogger);\n​\n// parse the caffe model to populate the network, then set the outputs\nINetworkDefinition* network = builder-&gt;createNetwork();\n​\nCaffeParser parser;\nauto blob_name_to_tensor = parser.parse(“deploy.prototxt”,\n​                                        trained_file.c_str(),\n​                                        *network,\n​                                        DataType::kFLOAT);\n​\n// specify which tensors are outputs\nnetwork-&gt;markOutput(*blob_name_to_tensor-&gt;find(\"prob\"));\n​\n// Build the engine\nbuilder-&gt;setMaxBatchSize(1);\nbuilder-&gt;setMaxWorkspaceSize(1 &lt;&lt; 30);\nICudaEngine* engine = builder-&gt;buildCudaEngine(*network);\n\nThen using the engine they would setup an inference pipeline, that would manage transferring data to the GPU and results back.\nTensorRT Engine Executor\n// The execution context is responsible for launching the\n// compute kernels\nIExecutionContext *context = engine-&gt;createExecutionContext();\n\n// In order to bind the buffers, we need to know the names of the\n// input and output tensors.\nint inputIndex = engine-&gt;getBindingIndex(INPUT_LAYER_NAME),\nint outputIndex = engine-&gt;getBindingIndex(OUTPUT_LAYER_NAME);\n\n// Allocate GPU memory for Input / Output data\nvoid* buffers = malloc(engine-&gt;getNbBindings() * sizeof(void*));\ncudaMalloc(&amp;buffers[inputIndex], batchSize * size_of_single_input);\ncudaMalloc(&amp;buffers[outputIndex], batchSize * size_of_single_output);\n\n// Use CUDA streams to manage the concurrency of copying and executing\ncudaStream_t stream;\ncudaStreamCreate(&amp;stream);\n\n// Copy Input Data to the GPU\ncudaMemcpyAsync(buffers[inputIndex], input,\n​                batchSize * size_of_single_input,\n​                cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);\n\n// Launch an instance of the GIE compute kernel\ncontext.enqueue(batchSize, buffers, stream, nullptr);\n\n// Copy Output Data to the Host\ncudaMemcpyAsync(output, buffers[outputIndex],\n​                batchSize * size_of_single_output,\n​                cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream);\n\n// It is possible to have multiple instances of the code above\n// in flight on the GPU in different streams.\n// The host can then sync on a given stream and use the results\ncudaStreamSynchronize(stream);\n\nFor people who had the resources to develop this sort of infrastructure it was entirely worth it to get the performance benefits, but to say the least it was in accessible for prototyping and light applications.\nEnter the TensorRT Python API\nFor actual deployments C++ is fine, if not preferable to Python,  especially in the embedded settings I was working in. However, there is still quite a bit of development work to be done between having a  trained model and putting it out in the world. One example is quantization.\nA Quick Primer on Quantization\nTypically (at least in 2017), neural networks are trained at FP32 precision. This is mostly due to the hardware available at that time specializing in FP32 math. But this precision has a lot more granularity than is necessary and ultimately you can get significant performance improvements by lowering the precision (to FP16 or INT8 or INT9 for example). For INT8 in particular, you need to go through a process called quantization that maps the range of weights onto an 8bit space.\nIn TensorRT there are APIs that help do this quantization for you in a way that hopefully minimizes the precision lost by using this less granular representation. This and other advanced features are usually what need to be experimented with before deploying a model but having to set up quantization infrastructure in C++ just for experiments is a lot of work.\nWrapping a C++ Library\nSo instead of having to rewrite a library in Python there are APIs and tools you can use to wrap an existing library and expose a python interface. This is in fact the approach that libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow use, a C++ core with a Python Frontend. There are couple tools that people use that automate the process of wrapping a library, one is SWIG which is able to auto generate an interface based on a header file and an interface file and PyBind11 a newer library that takes more work to define an interface but is lighter weight. For easy of prototyping and the shear amount of code to wrap I chose to use SWIG in my initial versions of the Python API for TensorRT but in later versions this was ported to PyBind11.\nTensorRT also requires directly interfacing with the CUDA Device API to transfer over data to a GPU and manage that memory through inference. There are a few python libraries that provide this capability. The one used officially with the TensorRT API is PyCUDA, but effort was put in to make sure other libraries such as CuPy (or even PyTorch) also work.\nIf you are going through the trouble to make a nice python API you should also try to abstract out a lot of the boilerplate that comes with a library targeted at C++ which I did in the utils sub package so as to maintain as much similarity between the C++ and Python APIs in the main package but allow for higher level features else where.\nAt this point I was able to do a lot of the basic work you'd want to do with TensorRT in Python:\nTensorRT Engine Builder in Python\nimport tensorrt as trt\nimport uff\nfrom tensorrt.parsers import caffeparser\nG_LOGGER = trt.infer.ConsoleLogger(trt.infer.LogSeverity.ERROR)\nOUTPUT_LAYERS = ['prob']\nMODEL_PROTOTXT = './data/mnist/mnist.prototxt'\nCAFFE_MODEL = './data/mnist/mnist.caffemodel'\nengine = trt.utils.caffe_to_trt_engine(G_LOGGER,\n                                       MODEL_PROTOTXT,\n                                       CAFFE_MODEL,\n                                       1,\n                                       1 &lt;&lt; 20,\n                                       OUTPUT_LAYERS,\n                                       trt.infer.DataType.FLOAT)\n\nTensorRT Engine Executor in Python\nruntime = trt.infer.create_infer_runtime(G_LOGGER)\ncontext = engine.create_execution_context()\nimg = img.astype(np.float32)\noutput = np.empty(10, dtype = np.float32)\n\nd_input = cuda.mem_alloc(1 * img.size * img.dtype.itemsize)\nd_output = cuda.mem_alloc(1 * output.size * output.dtype.itemsize)\nbindings = [int(d_input), int(d_output)]\n\nstream = cuda.Stream()\ncuda.memcpy_htod_async(d_input, img, stream)\ncontext.enqueue(1, bindings, stream.handle, None)\ncuda.memcpy_dtoh_async(output, d_output, stream)\nstream.synchronize()\nprint (\"Prediction: \" + str(np.argmax(output)))\n\nLeveraging the Python Ecosystem\nThere are some great things about python that make life a lot easier. Data manipulation with NumPy for one is a massive benefit, so is being able to directly interface with other deep learning frameworks and tools. So one of the first things I added as soon as the library was wrapped was NumPy compatibility. This means that you can use NumPy arrays not only for your data, but also to transfer your weights around. This allows people using libraries like PyTorch (note: this was before ONNX came out) to extract their weights into NumPy arrays and then load them into TensorRT all in Python.\nImporting a PyTorch Model Manually\n# Given a net\nclass Net(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(Net, self).__init__()\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 20, kernel_size=5)\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(20, 50, kernel_size=5)\n        self.conv2_drop = nn.Dropout2d()\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(800, 500)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(500, 10)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = F.max_pool2d(self.conv1(x), kernel_size=2, stride=2)\n        x = F.max_pool2d(self.conv2(x), kernel_size=2, stride=2)\n        x = x.view(-1, 800)\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = self.fc2(x)\n        return F.log_softmax(x)\n\nmodel = Net()\nweights = model.state_dict()\n\nG_LOGGER = trt.infer.ConsoleLogger(trt.infer.LogSeverity.ERROR)\nbuilder = trt.infer.create_infer_builder(G_LOGGER)\n\nnetwork = builder.create_network()\n\n#Name for the input layer, data type, tuple for dimension\ndata = network.add_input(\"data\", trt.infer.DataType.FLOAT, (1, 28, 28))\nassert(data)\n\n#-------------\nconv1_w = weights['conv1.weight'].cpu().numpy().reshape(-1)\nconv1_b = weights['conv1.bias'].cpu().numpy().reshape(-1)\nconv1 = network.add_convolution(data, 20, (5,5),  conv1_w, conv1_b)\nassert(conv1)\nconv1.set_stride((1,1))\n\n#-------------\npool1 = network.add_pooling(conv1.get_output(0), trt.infer.PoolingType.MAX, (2,2))\nassert(pool1)\npool1.set_stride((2,2))\n\n#-------------\nconv2_w = weights['conv2.weight'].cpu().numpy().reshape(-1)\nconv2_b = weights['conv2.bias'].cpu().numpy().reshape(-1)\nconv2 = network.add_convolution(pool1.get_output(0), 50, (5,5), conv2_w, conv2_b)\nassert(conv2)\nconv2.set_stride((1,1))\n\n#-------------\npool2 = network.add_pooling(conv2.get_output(0), trt.infer.PoolingType.MAX, (2,2))\nassert(pool2)\npool2.set_stride((2,2))\n\n#-------------\nfc1_w = weights['fc1.weight'].cpu().numpy().reshape(-1)\nfc1_b = weights['fc1.bias'].cpu().numpy().reshape(-1)\nfc1 = network.add_fully_connected(pool2.get_output(0), 500, fc1_w, fc1_b)\nassert(fc1)\n\n#-------------\nrelu1 = network.add_activation(fc1.get_output(0), trt.infer.ActivationType.RELU)\nassert(relu1)\n\n#-------------\nfc2_w = weights['fc2.weight'].cpu().numpy().reshape(-1)\nfc2_b = weights['fc2.bias'].cpu().numpy().reshape(-1)\nfc2 = network.add_fully_connected(relu1.get_output(0), 10, fc2_w, fc2_b)\nassert(fc2)\n\nfc2.get_output(0).set_name(\"prob\")\nnetwork.mark_output(fc2.get_output(0))\n\nbuilder.set_max_batch_size(1)\nbuilder.set_max_workspace_size(1 &lt;&lt; 20)\n\nengine = builder.build_cuda_engine(network)\nnetwork.destroy()\nbuilder.destroy()\n\nThis was a new capability introduced by the Python API because of Python and NumPy.\nWe can also use NumPy and other tools like SciPy to do some of the data preprocessing required for inference and the quantization pipeline.\nQuantization with TensorRT Python\nThis blog post describes using the Python API to do the majority of the work for INT8 Quantization and deploying on a embedded platform:\nhttps://devblogs.nvidia.com/int8-inference-autonomous-vehicles-tensorrt/?utm_content=buffer46af6&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\nHigher level APIs\nUsing Python allows for a lot of abstracted work. One of the things introduced in the Python API is the Lite API a essentially one liner to create an engine and run it.\n#Post Processing Callback, Should take a 5D Tensor, run post processing and return a single object\ndef analyze(output_data):\n    #Results from the engine are returned as a list of 5D numpy arrays:\n    #        (Number of Batches x Batch Size x C x H x W)\n    output = output_data.reshape(len(LABELS))\n    # Get result\n    top = np.argmax(output)\n    top = LABELS[top]\n    # Get top5\n    top5 = np.argpartition(output, -5, axis=-1)[-5:]\n    top5 = top5[np.argsort(output[top5])][::-1]`\n    top5_classes = []\n    for i in top5:\n        top5_classes.append((LABELS[i], output[i]))\n    return [top, top5_classes]\n\n#Arguments to create lite engine\nnetwork = {\"framework\":\"tf\",                                     #Source framework\n           \"path\":DATA+\"/resnet50/resnet50-infer-5.pb\",          #Path to frozen model\n           \"input_nodes\":{\"input\":(3,224,224)},                  #Dictionary of input nodes and their associated dimensions\n           \"output_nodes\":[\"GPU_0/tower_0/Softmax\"],             #List of output nodes\n           \"logger_severity\":LogSeverity.INFO,                   #Debugging info\n           \"postprocessors\":{\"GPU_0/tower_0/Softmax\":analyze}}   #Postprocessor function table\n\nengine = Engine(**network)\n\nAnd that defines a full pipeline with pre/post processing allowing for integration with other apps easily. The lite api also supports a variety of batching formats automatically so its pretty easy to just throw data at it and get results out.\nTake a look at the examples in the TensorRT distribution for demonstrations of this.\nEnabling other applications\nSince it's now easy to integrate TensorRT its pretty straightforward to include optimized deep learning models in your projects. This enables a lot of cool new applications in spaces such as smart cities, robotics and web applications.\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/tensorrt-python-api/","title":"TensorRT Python API"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/trtorch/":{"body":"In the practice of developing machine learning models, there are few tools as approachable as PyTorch for developing and experimenting in designing machine learning models. The power of PyTorch comes from its deep integration into Python, its flexibility and its approach to automatic differentiation and execution (eager execution). However, when moving from research into production, the requirements change and we may no longer want that deep Python integration and we want optimization to get the best performance we can on our deployment platform. In PyTorch 1.0, TorchScript was introduced as a method to separate your PyTorch model from Python, make it portable and optimizable. TorchScript uses PyTorch's JIT compiler to transform your normal PyTorch code which gets interpreted by the Python interpreter to an intermediate representation (IR) which can have optimizations run on it and at runtime can get interpreted by the PyTorch JIT interpreter. For PyTorch this has opened up a whole new world of possibilities, including deployment in other languages like C++. It also introduces a structured graph based format that we can use to do down to the kernel level optimization of models for inference.\nWhen deploying on NVIDIA GPUs TensorRT, NVIDIA's Deep Learning Optimization SDK and Runtime is able to take models from any major framework and specifically tune them to perform better on specific target hardware in the NVIDIA family be it an A100, TITAN V, Jetson Xavier or NVIDIA's Deep Learning Accelerator. TensorRT performs a couple sets of optimizations to achieve this. TensorRT fuses layers and tensors in the model graph, it then uses a large kernel library to select implementations that perform best on the target GPU. TensorRT also has strong support for reduced operating precision execution which allows users to leverage the Tensor Cores on Volta and newer GPUs as well as reducing memory and computation footprints on device.\nTRTorch is a compiler that uses TensorRT to optimize TorchScript code, compiling standard TorchScript modules into ones that internally run with TensorRT optimizations. This enables you to continue to remain in the PyTorch ecosystem, using all the great features PyTorch has such as module composability, its flexible tensor implementation, data loaders and more. TRTorch is available to use with both PyTorch and LibTorch. Here is a quick example on how to use it.\nCreating a TorchScript Module\nWhen developing models in PyTorch, modules are the unit of composition, you create or use subclasses of torch.nn.module which are composed into a super module representing your model.  Here is a simple LeNet implementation:\nclass LeNetFeatExtractor(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(LeNetFeatExtractor, self).__init__()\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 6, 3)\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 3)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = F.max_pool2d(F.relu(self.conv1(x)), (2, 2))\n        x = F.max_pool2d(F.relu(self.conv2(x)), 2)\n        return x\n\nclass LeNetClassifier(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(LeNetClassifier, self).__init__()\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 6 * 6, 120)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = torch.flatten(x,1)\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))\n        x = self.fc3(x)\n        return x\n\nclass LeNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(LeNet, self).__init__()\n        self.feat = LeNetFeatExtractor()\n        self.classifer = LeNetClassifier()\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.feat(x)\n        x = self.classifer(x)\n        return x\n\nHere we create two submodules for a feature extractor and a classifier and stitch them together in a single LeNet module. In this case this is overkill but modules give us granular control over our program including where we decide to optimize and where we don't. It is also the unit that the TorchScript compiler operates on. So you can decide to only convert/optimize the feature extractor and leave the classifier in standard PyTorch or you can convert the whole thing. When compiling your module to TorchScript, there are two paths: Tracing and Scripting.\nTracing\nTracing follows the path of execution when the module is called and records what happens. This recording is what the TorchScript IR will describe. To trace an instance of our LeNet module, we can call torch.jit.trace  with an example input.\nmodel = LeNet()\ntraced_model = torch.jit.trace(model, torch.empty([1,1,32,32]))\n\nScripting\nScripting actually inspects your code with a compiler and  generates an equivalent TorchScript program. The difference is that since tracing simply follows the execution of your module, it cannot pick up control flow for instance, it will only follow the code path that a particular input triggers. By working from the Python code, the compiler can include these components. We can run the script compiler on our LeNet  module by calling torch.jit.script.\nmodel = LeNet()\nscript_model = torch.jit.script(model)\n\nThere are reasons to use one path or another, the PyTorch documentation has information on how to choose and more information on TorchScript https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html. From a TRTorch perspective, there is better support (i.e your module is more likely to compile) for traced modules because it doesn’t include all the complexities of a complete programming language, though both paths are supported.\nAfter scripting or tracing your module, you are given back a TorchScript Module. This contains the code and parameters used to run the module stored in an intermediate representation. Here is what the LeNet traced module IR looks like:\ngraph(%self.1 : __torch__.___torch_mangle_10.LeNet,\n    %input.1 : Float(1, 1, 32, 32)):\n    %129 : __torch__.___torch_mangle_9.LeNetClassifier = prim::GetAttr[name=\"classifer\"](%self.1)\n    %119 : __torch__.___torch_mangle_5.LeNetFeatExtractor = prim::GetAttr[name=\"feat\"](%self.1)\n    %137 : Tensor = prim::CallMethod[name=\"forward\"](%119, %input.1)\n    %138 : Tensor = prim::CallMethod[name=\"forward\"](%129, %137)\n    return (%138)\n\nand the LeNet scripted module IR:\ngraph(%self : __torch__.LeNet,\n    %x.1 : Tensor):\n    %2 : __torch__.LeNetFeatExtractor = prim::GetAttr[name=\"feat\"](%self)\n    %x.3 : Tensor = prim::CallMethod[name=\"forward\"](%2, %x.1) # x.py:38:12\n    %5 : __torch__.LeNetClassifier = prim::GetAttr[name=\"classifer\"](%self)\n    %x.5 : Tensor = prim::CallMethod[name=\"forward\"](%5, %x.3) # x.py:39:12\n    return (%x.5)\n\nYou can see that the IR preserves the module structure we have in our python code.\nFrom the user perspective it behaves like a normal PyTorch module. You can run the forward pass using the forward method or just calling the module torch_script_module(in_tensor). The JIT interpreter will run the module and return the results. From here we are in a position to compile our module further to run more efficiently on GPUs with TRTorch.\nCompiling with TRTorch in Python\nTo compile your TorchScript module with TRTorch, all you need to do is provide the module and some compiler settings to TRTorch and you will be returned an optimized TorchScript module to run or add into another PyTorch module. The only required setting is the input size for applications which will have a static input size which is defined as a list of either list types like lists, tuples or PyTorch size objects. If your application needs to support a range of sizes, entries in the list should be dictionaries of minimum, optimal and maximum sizes which describe the range of dimensions that the auto-tuner should use for optimization. The auto-tuner will select kernels which have the lowest runtime for the optimal size but are valid through the range of dimensions specified. You can also specify settings such as operating precision for the engine or target device.\nimport trtorch\n\n...\ncompile_settings = {\n    \"input_shapes\": [\n        {\n            \"min\": [1, 3, 224, 224],\n            \"opt\": [1, 3, 512, 512],\n            \"max\": [1, 3, 1024, 1024]\n        }, # For static size [1, 3, 224, 224]\n    ],\n    \"op_precision\": torch.half # Run with FP16\n}\n\ntrt_ts_module = trtorch.compile(torch_script_module, compile_settings)\n\ninput_data = input_data.half()\nresult = trt_ts_module(input_data)\n\nWorking with TorchScript in C++\nAfter converting a PyTorch module to TorchScript our dependency on Python ends. We can just save our TorchScript module using torch.jit.save which will serialize the TorchScript code, weights and other information into a package and load it in a C++ application.\n#include &lt;torch/script.h&gt; // One-stop header.\n\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;memory&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, const char* argv[]) {\n    torch::jit::Module module;\n    try {\n        // Deserialize the ScriptModule from a file using torch::jit::load().\n        module = torch::jit::load(\"&lt;PATH TO SAVED TS MOD&gt;\");\n    }\n    catch (const c10::Error&amp; e) {\n        std::cerr &lt;&lt; \"error loading the model\\n\";\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"ok\\n\";\n\nYou can do full training and inference in C++ with LibTorch if you would like, you can even define your modules in C++ and have access to the same powerful tensor library that backs PyTorch. (For more information: https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/). For instance we can run inference with our module like this:\nmod.eval();\ntorch::Tensor in = torch::randn({1, 1, 32, 32});\nauto out = mod.forward(in);\n\nand to run on the GPU:\nmod.eval();\nmod.to(torch::kCUDA);\ntorch::Tensor in = torch::randn({1, 1, 32, 32}, torch::kCUDA);\nauto out = mod.forward(in);\n\nAs you can see it is pretty similar to the Python API. When you call the forward method, you again invoke the JIT interpreter in the same way running a PyTorch module in Python would to run the TorchScript code and return back the results.\nCompiling with TRTorch in C++\nWe are also at the point where we can compile and optimize our module with TRTorch in C++. With our module loaded, we can feed it into the TRTorch compiler. When we do so, we must provide a similar set of additional information on the expected input size and also configure any settings when we do.\n#include \"torch/script.h\"\n#include \"trtorch/trtorch.h\"\n...\n\n    mod.to(at::kCUDA);\n    mod.eval();\n\n    auto in = torch::randn({1, 1, 32, 32}, {torch::kCUDA});\n    auto trt_mod = trtorch::CompileGraph(mod, std::vector&lt;trtorch::ExtraInfo::InputRange&gt;{{in.sizes()}});\n    auto out = trt_mod.forward({in});\n\nThat’s it! Now the graph runs a TensorRT optimized version of the module through the JIT interpreter.\nWe can also set settings like operating precision to run in FP16.\n#include \"torch/script.h\"\n#include \"trtorch/trtorch.h\"\n...\n\n    mod.to(at::kCUDA);\n    mod.eval();\n\n    auto in = torch::randn({1, 1, 32, 32}, {torch::kCUDA}).to(torch::kHALF);\n    auto input_sizes = std::vector&lt;trtorch::ExtraInfo::InputRange&gt;({in.sizes()});\n    trtorch::ExtraInfo info(input_sizes);\n    info.op_precision = torch::kHALF;\n    auto trt_mod = trtorch::CompileGraph(mod, info);\n    auto out = trt_mod.forward({in});\n\nAnd now we are running the module in FP16 precision.\nIf you want to save the engine produced by TRTorch to use in a TensorRT application, you can use the ConvertGraphToTRTEngine API (this API is available in Python as well and is compatible with the TensorRT Python API to deploy).\n#include \"torch/script.h\"\n#include \"trtorch/trtorch.h\"\n...\n\n    mod.to(at::kCUDA);\n    mod.eval();\n\n    auto in = torch::randn({1, 1, 32, 32}, {torch::kCUDA}).to(torch::kHALF);\n    auto input_sizes = std::vector&lt;trtorch::ExtraInfo::InputRange&gt;({in.sizes()});\n    trtorch::ExtraInfo info(input_sizes);\n    info.op_precision = torch::kHALF;\n    auto trt_mod = trtorch::ConvertGraphToTRTEngine(mod, \"forward\", info);\n    std::ofstream out(\"/tmp/engine_converted_from_jit.trt\");\n    out &lt;&lt; engine;\n    out.close();\n\nCompiler Internals\nWhen a module is provided to TRTorch, it goes through three main phases, lowering, compilation, and execution.\nLowering Phase\nThe lowering is made up of a set of passes (some from PyTorch and some specific to TRTorch) run over the graph IR to map the large PyTorch opset to a reduced opset that is easier to convert to TensorRT.\ngraph(%input.2 : Tensor):\n    %2 : Float(84, 10) = prim::Constant[value=&lt;Tensor&gt;]()\n    %3 : Float(120, 84) = prim::Constant[value=&lt;Tensor&gt;]()\n    %4 : Float(576, 120) = prim::Constant[value=&lt;Tensor&gt;]()\n    %5 : int = prim::Constant[value=-1]() # x.py:25:0\n    %6 : int[] = prim::Constant[value=annotate(List[int], [])]()\n    %7 : int[] = prim::Constant[value=[2, 2]]()\n    %8 : int[] = prim::Constant[value=[0, 0]]()\n    %9 : int[] = prim::Constant[value=[1, 1]]()\n    %10 : bool = prim::Constant[value=1]() # ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/conv.py:346:0\n    %11 : int = prim::Constant[value=1]() # ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py:539:0\n    %12 : bool = prim::Constant[value=0]() # ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py:539:0\n    %self.classifer.fc3.bias : Float(10) = prim::Constant[value= 0.0464  0.0383  0.0678  0.0932  0.1045 -0.0805 -0.0435 -0.0818  0.0208 -0.0358 [ CUDAFloatType{10} ]]()\n    %self.classifer.fc2.bias : Float(84) = prim::Constant[value=&lt;Tensor&gt;]()\n    %self.classifer.fc1.bias : Float(120) = prim::Constant[value=&lt;Tensor&gt;]()\n    %self.feat.conv2.weight : Float(16, 6, 3, 3) = prim::Constant[value=&lt;Tensor&gt;]()\n    %self.feat.conv2.bias : Float(16) = prim::Constant[value=&lt;Tensor&gt;]()\n    %self.feat.conv1.weight : Float(6, 1, 3, 3) = prim::Constant[value=&lt;Tensor&gt;]()\n    %self.feat.conv1.bias : Float(6) = prim::Constant[value= 0.0530 -0.1691  0.2802  0.1502  0.1056 -0.1549 [ CUDAFloatType{6} ]]()\n    %input0.4 : Tensor = aten::_convolution(%input.2, %self.feat.conv1.weight, %self.feat.conv1.bias, %9, %8, %9, %12, %8, %11, %12, %12, %10) # ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/conv.py:346:0\n    %input0.5 : Tensor = aten::relu(%input0.4) # ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py:1063:0\n    %input1.2 : Tensor = aten::max_pool2d(%input0.5, %7, %6, %8, %9, %12) # ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py:539:0\n    %input0.6 : Tensor = aten::_convolution(%input1.2, %self.feat.conv2.weight, %self.feat.conv2.bias, %9, %8, %9, %12, %8, %11, %12, %12, %10) # ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/conv.py:346:0\n    %input2.1 : Tensor = aten::relu(%input0.6) # ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py:1063:0\n    %x.1 : Tensor = aten::max_pool2d(%input2.1, %7, %6, %8, %9, %12) # ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py:539:0\n    %input.1 : Tensor = aten::flatten(%x.1, %11, %5) # x.py:25:0\n    %27 : Tensor = aten::matmul(%input.1, %4)\n    %28 : Tensor = trt::const(%self.classifer.fc1.bias)\n    %29 : Tensor = aten::add_(%28, %27, %11)\n    %input0.2 : Tensor = aten::relu(%29) # ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py:1063:0\n    %31 : Tensor = aten::matmul(%input0.2, %3)\n    %32 : Tensor = trt::const(%self.classifer.fc2.bias)\n    %33 : Tensor = aten::add_(%32, %31, %11)\n    %input1.1 : Tensor = aten::relu(%33) # ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/functional.py:1063:0\n    %35 : Tensor = aten::matmul(%input1.1, %2)\n    %36 : Tensor = trt::const(%self.classifer.fc3.bias)\n    %37 : Tensor = aten::add_(%36, %35, %11)\n    return (%37)\n(CompileGraph)\n\nThe graph has now been transformed from a collection of modules, each managing their own parameters into a single graph with the  parameters inlined into the graph and all of the operations laid out. TRTorch has also executed a number of optimizations and mappings to make the graph easier to translate to TensorRT and produces more efficient TensorRT engines. From here the compiler can assemble the TensorRT engine by following the dataflow through the graph.\nConversion Phase\nIn the conversion phase we traverse the lowered graph and construct an equivalent TensorRT graph. The conversion phase is made up of three main components, a context to manage compile time data, a evaluator library which will execute operations that can be resolved at compile time and a converter library which maps an op from JIT to TensorRT. Operations are mapped to TensorRT through the use of modular converters, functions that take a node from a the JIT graph and produce an equivalent layer or subgraph in TensorRT. TRTorch ships with a library of these converters stored in a registry, that will be executed depending on the node being analyzed. For instance an aten::relu(%input0.4) instruction will trigger the ReLU converter to be run on it, producing an activation layer in the TensorRT graph.\nFor example, if we try to compile a graph with a build of TRTorch that doesn’t support the flatten operation (aten::flatten) you may see this error:\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'trtorch::Error'\nwhat():  [enforce fail at core/conversion/conversion.cpp:109] Expected converter to be true but got false\nUnable to convert node: %input.1 : Tensor = aten::flatten(%x.1, %11, %5) # x.py:25:0 (conversion.AddLayer)\nSchema: aten::flatten.using_ints(Tensor self, int start_dim=0, int end_dim=-1) -&gt; (Tensor)\nConverter for aten::flatten requested, but no such converter was found.\nIf you need a converter for this operator, you can try implementing one yourself\nor request a converter: https://www.github.com/NVIDIA/TRTorch/issues\n\nWe register converters in the global converter registry, associating a function schema like aten::flatten.using_ints(Tensor self, int start_dim=0, int end_dim=-1) -&gt; (Tensor) with a lambda that will take the state of the conversion, the node/operation in question to convert and all of the inputs to the node and produces as a side effect a new layer in the TensorRT network. Arguments are passed as a vector of inspectable unions of TensorRT ITensors and Torch IValues (PyTorch data such as Tensors, ints, lists, etc.) in the order arguments are listed in the schema.\nBelow is an implementation of an aten::flatten converter.\n#include \"torch/script.h\"\n#include \"trtorch/trtorch.h\"\n#include \"trtorch/core/conversion/converters/converters.h\"\n\nstatic auto flatten_converter = trtorch::core::conversion::converters::RegisterNodeConversionPatterns()\n    .pattern({\n        \"aten::flatten.using_ints(Tensor self, int start_dim=0, int end_dim=-1) -&gt; (Tensor)\",\n        [](trtorch::core::conversion::ConversionCtx* ctx,\n            const torch::jit::Node* n,\n            trtorch::core::conversion::converters::args&amp; args) -&gt; bool {\n            auto in = args[0].ITensor();\n            auto start_dim = args[1].unwrapToInt();\n            auto end_dim = args[2].unwrapToInt();\n            auto in_shape = trtorch::core::util::toVec(in-&gt;getDimensions());\n            auto out_shape = torch::flatten(torch::rand(in_shape), start_dim, end_dim).sizes();\n\n            auto shuffle = ctx-&gt;net-&gt;addShuffle(*in);\n            shuffle-&gt;setReshapeDimensions(trtorch::core::util::toDims(out_shape));\n            shuffle-&gt;setName(trtorch::core::util::node_info(n).c_str());\n\n            auto out_tensor = ctx-&gt;AssociateValueAndTensor(n-&gt;outputs()[0], shuffle-&gt;getOutput(0));\n            return true;\n        }\n    });\n\nWriting Converters\nConverter Contract\nWhat is guaranteed to converters\n\nIn the args there will be an entry for each node input value, either a ITensor or IValue\nInputs will be provided in order according to the function schema\n\nResponsibilities of a converter\n\nArgs must be guaranteed to be a type to unwrap the Arg union without checking, typically input tensor arguments can be expected to be ITensors\nAny weights or static values must guaranteed to be valid until the end of conversion time\nConverters are expected to produce an IValue or ITensor for each output of a node. The compiler will check this and produce warnings if there are Values that don’t have associated ITensors or IValues.\nOutputs must be annotated. There must be an association between a JIT nodes output values and the new TRT layers output tensors in the value_tensor_map in the conversion context\n\nConversion Context\nThe conversion context maintains the state of conversion, it manages the Network Definition, two maps one that stores associations between Values and IValues (the evaluated_value_map) and one that stores associations between Values and ITensors, and any sort of memory that needs to live until the end of conversion. The main apis that you will interface with in converters is directly accessing the network definition to add layers ctx-&gt;net and data association functions ctx-&gt;AssociateValueAndTensor() and ctx-&gt;AssociateValueAndIValue(), which you will use to add layers to the TRT layers and log pairs of node outputs and static values or TensorRT layer outputs.\nArgs\nArguments provided to the converter are inspectable unions of nvinfer1::ITensors and torch::jit::IValues (i.e. abstract dataflow in the TensorRT graph and static values). You are guaranteed that you will have some argument for each input value for the node. They are provided in the order of the function schema. It can be expected that inputs (meaning the parameters that would be passed into the forward function of a module in PyTorch) will be ITensors but the Arg class also has mechanisms to inspect arguments safely before unwrapping if you are unsure. Args also have deep unwrap methods that let you get straight to the underlying data in an IValue if you know it’s safe. You can also pass in a fallback value if there is a chance the IValue is None. IValues have been extended to be able to hold a wrapper around ITensors only in the case of TensorLists. You can get an ITensor from an IValue by a pattern similar to this: ivalue.toCustomClass()-&gt;tensor() . You can tell if an IValue contains a Tensor or an ITensor by using ivalue.isTensor() or ivalue.isCustomClass() .\nWeights\nWeights are used during build time, so any weights need to be guaranteed to live until the end of the conversion phase. TensorRT also uses its own weights structure to hold the weights. There is a wrapper around this class available to converts which abstracts a lot of this.\nThe weights wrapper class can accept either at::Tensors or singular values (right now). You also need to pass the conversion context when constructing these weights because internally the weights class will allocate memory managed by the conversion context to store a copy of the tensor data. This data gets freed when the conversion context destructor gets destroyed so converters don’t really need to think about it.\nThere is metadata generated from the shape of the input data which becomes useful in interfacing with TensorRT, such as number of input maps, number of output maps and kernel shape.\nThe complier will topologically traverse the graph from the lowering phase and then iteratively construct the TensorRT graph. Once it is complete, the graph is optimized for the target hardware using TensorRT's library of tuned kernel implementations. Here TRTorch creates a JIT Module to execute the TensorRT engine which will be  instantiated and managed by the TRTorch runtime.\nHere is the graph that you get back after compilation is complete:\ngraph(%self.1 : __torch__.___torch_mangle_10.LeNet_trt,\n    %2 : Tensor):\n    %1 : int = prim::Constant[value=94106001690080]()\n    %3 : Tensor = trt::execute_engine(%1, %2)\n    return (%3)\n(AddEngineToGraph)\n\nYou can see the call where the engine is executed, based on a constant which is the ID of the engine, telling JIT how to find the engine and the input tensor which will be fed to TensorRT.\nRuntime Phase\nAfter the graph is provided to the user, it is now a fully compliant TorchScript module. You can seralize and deserialize it the same way and all that is required is to have the TRTorch runtime loaded in memory.\nGetting TRTorch\nTRTorch 0.1.0 precompiled binaries are available on GitHub https://github.com/NVIDIA/TRTorch/releases You can get a tarball distribution of the C++ API (either pre-CXX11 ABI or CXX11 ABI builds) and wheel files for the Python package, which is installable via pip. To get the latest and greatest, you can compile the library and/or the Python package from source following these instructions: https://nvidia.github.io/TRTorch/tutorials/installation.html. Compilation on embedded platforms like Jetson is possible via minor modifications to the build system.\nMore Information\nI gave two talks on TRTorch at the GPU Technology Conference:\n\n\nTRTorch: A PyTorch/TorchScript Compiler Targeting NVIDIA GPUs Using TensorRT - GTC 2020 October\n\n\n\n\nPyTorch-TensorRT: Accelerating Inference in PyTorch with TensorRT - GTC 2020\n\n\n\nGithub: https://github.com/NVIDIA/TRTorch/\nProject Page: https://nvidia.github.io/TRTorch/\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/trtorch/","title":"TRTorch: A compiler for TorchScript Targeting NVIDIA GPUs"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/twilight/":{"body":"\n\nA portion of the Twilight Installation in the office of ACM@UIUC\n\nTwilight is a concept for self organizing office lighting based on similar ideas to my work on\nthe Amorphous Facade. I did this work for my Undergraduate Senior Project\nwith Rauhul Varma and advised by Rebecca Chen and Prof. Can Bayram.\nPhillips Hue and similar lighting systems are really popular and they actually can have health\nbenefits for their users as well as be a useful display of information. Having the correct color temperature\nat certain times of day for example improves peoples' happiness and their productivity. Since\nwe spend a majority of our days in the office, it makes sense that we would want similar benefits\nat work. Solutions like Hue won't work in the office place due to their architecture. They operate\non a hub spoke model where lights will connect to a hub which connects the lights to the network\nwhere they will be controlled by a cloud service, operated by Phillips themselves. Users are therefore\nbeholden to Phillips to keep the service running in order to access their lights. This immediately\nis not acceptable to a business. This architecture also limits scalability and increases network congestion,\nwhere for every $N$ lights you need $M$ hubs. This sort of model is common place across the\nrange of IoT devices and as a rebuttal to the current industry approach to ubiquitous computing, we present a lighting\nplatform called Twilight that seeks to demonstrate the potential of intelligent and easy to\nuse smart devices. Twilight achieves these goals by applying ideas from the field of swarm robotics and developing\na lighting system that is self-organizing and reconfigurable.\n\n\nConcept art for Twilight, lights are designed to be compatible with standard ceiling tiles and magnetically mounted.\n\nHaving these properties allows you to infinitely scale out the system, no longer requiring hubs to connect them.\nLights communicate amongst themselves in order to change properties like their colors and having federated control\nof the lighting system creates desirable properties like fault tolerance. If key nodes in the system go down,\nthe lighting system is resilient or in the worst case can partition itself into two separate fully operational systems.\nHardware\nEach light is setup as a box, the size of a standard ceiling tile and ringed with magnets for mounting. On the internal\nperimeter there is reflective tape and an LED strip as the actual light source. The strip is controlled by a Raspberry Pi\nand a custom control board which also connects the light to other lights in the network. Blocks are run off standard $120 VAC$\nwall power.\n\n\nThe hardware architecture for Twilight\n\n\n\nThe custom controller for Twilight node\n\nSoftware\nWe chose a Raspberry Pi because in addition to building this project for our Senior Design Project we also\nmade this as an installation for the UIUC Chapter of ACM. It was meant to be installed in their office and\nserve as a teaching tool for swarm robotics. Raspberry Pis make Twilight way more accessible than an embedded\nprogramming environment.\n\n\nThe software architecture for Twilight\n\nSelf-Organization\nThe whole point of this system is that we can build a bunch of lights, but they organize themselves to\ncreate smart behavior. The first step is localization. Conveniently, the lights are arranged in a grid on\nthe ceiling. We therefore start by gossiping between nodes until they elect a leader, the block with the\n\"lowest MAC address\". This node will also be the \"border router\" the bridge between the LAN and the Twilight network.\nThis is dynamic role so if this node is lost then a new border router is elected. This node also serves as the origin of the grid.\nFrom here messages are propagated telling nodes their coordinates until each node knows where it is. Now developers can create\napplications which just index nodes in the grid and set states for them or they can send out a global command and let the network\nresolve how to implement it. For instance below is a example of a command to set the grid white. Nodes receive and send commands until\nall nodes are the right color.\n\nThe Installation\nHere are some cool videos and pictures of the system.\n\n\nTwilight running on the ceiling of the ACM office\n\n\n\nInstalling a Twilight node\n\n\n\nThree twilight nodes connected\n\n\nYou can find the full thesis here: Twilight: Reconfigurable Self Organizing Office Lighting\n\n\nYou can find the source code and schematics can be found here: https://github.com/acm-uiuc/twilight-old\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/twilight/","title":"Twilight"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/twitter-algo/":{"body":"This week has been weird to say the least. We have fringe figures in the artificial intelligence community publishing opinions in Time Magazine on the need to take violent action to stop the propagation of large language models, but I thought the most important story was Elon Musk and Twitter releasing the source code for their Tweet recommendation system.\n\nI'm going to keep referring to this thing as a system or engine. I refuse to call it an algorithm. There are no strong guarantees associated with these systems, they mostly boil down to a collection of heuristics. Calling them an algorithm bastardizes the meaning of the term.\n\n\nThere's a lot of reasons to be tired of hearing about Twitter and Elon Musk. Twitter is a navel-gazy self important subculture full of \"niche internet celebrities\" being toxic to each other in one way or another. And Elon oscillates from being out of touch to down right unhinged depending on the hour. However, Twitter and other social media platforms for many, and particularly many who occupy other places of influence in society, serves as their primary lens on the state of the world. Many measure importance of issues, people, ideas etc. based on the traction they garner on these platforms. Therefore, it matters how and why some things are widely promoted and somethings are suppressed.\nWhen Twitter released the source, Elon put out the following Tweet.\nMost of the recommendation algorithm will be made open source today. The rest will follow.Acid test is that independent third parties should be able to determine, with reasonable accuracy, what will probably be shown to users.No doubt, many embarrassing issues will be… https://t.co/41U4oexIev— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 31, 2023 \nI do not care what your opinion of him or his actions were, the stated goal \"[T]hat independent third parties should be able to determine, with reasonable accuracy, what will probably be shown to users\" is a great one and should become the industry standard if not required by law to operate a walled (more on this caveat later) hosted consumer internet service.\nThe choices these systems make deeply influence society. Revolutions, political movements, conspiracy theories all have been amplified or suppressed based on the opaque decisions of private actors and have effected billions of people with their actions. We do not know to what extent the Arab Spring, Black Lives Matter, various COVID-19 related conspiracies have been enabled and \"unnaturally\" propagated or suppressed due to the operation of these recommendation systems. How would ethinic relations in South Asia look without content recommendation systems mediating what people see? We have no idea if the stated values of platforms match what they recommend, all we get is little boxes on hot-button issues and handed down judgments from unaccountable panels\nThis issue applies past the realm of social media. Models control access to credit, access to health care, hiring decisions and entrance into elite institutions. Most of these systems are entirely black-box. The source data is not available and the modeling is not available. Yet we let these things make meaningful decisions in society.\nWe get some information from company blog posts and leaks. But, many try to divine the incentives these models encode in a way reminiscent of a priest trying to divine the will of the Gods. Some say all that matters is engagement - just things that make you feel a strong emotion. Others say that these models try to recommend things that are easy to advertise against. People's livelihoods are tied to trying to figure out what will be most favored by the \"Algorithm\". However, code is code, and with the release people have taken to searching through and trying to glean insights.\nTwitter revealed its algorithm to the world. But what does it mean for you?I spent the evening analyzing it.Here’s what you need to know:— Aakash Gupta 🚀 Product Growth Guy (@aakashg0) April 1, 2023 \nTwitter just open-sourced their algorithm.Some initial takeaways:◆ Your following to follower ratio matters.◆ @TwitterBlue subscribers do get a boost in the algorithm.Will keep adding more to this thread 👇— Steven Tey (@steventey) March 31, 2023 \nSo, Twitter open-sourced The Algorithm...I was so close (at least for the toxicity/abuse/nsfw detection models) https://t.co/I4aiSkkcHm pic.twitter.com/5DJUCvUbov— François Chollet (@fchollet) March 31, 2023 \nAnd most hilariously:\n\nWhat people found is that some types of engagement (likes) are preferable to others. Some types of content (multimedia) are better than others (links). And it really matters if you are Elon Musk. These rules encode biases (in the ML sense) that have far reaching effects. Likes being preferable to replies or retweets incentivize quippy one liners over substantive back and froths or long threads. Promoting multimedia embeds and penalizing links is a way to keep people on twitter.com and not constantly leaving the site. And it's easy to make your boss feel like the most important person in the world if his tweets get sent to everyone.\nPeople have figured out some of this without the source code but having the source, potentially having researchers try to set up model systems and experimentally discover emergent properties is another level. Work like Obermeyer et. al. serves as a model of what should be performed on all these sort of systems. They try to find evidence of racial bias in UnitedHealth's models used to recommend additional care to patients. They get access to the training dataset and objective function used by UnitedHealth and notably find race is not an explicit factor considered by the model. However, the model uses \"total medical expenditures\" as a proxy for the \"prediction on health needs\". I.e. an encoded assumption of the system is that people who spend more on healthcare need more healthcare. They find that when considering this, there is no bias w.r.t race in UnitedHealth's model. However the fact of the matter is that African Americans spend less on average than Caucasian Americans on health care, so while the model itself does not discriminate, UnitedHealth neglects folks who could use additional care because larger demographic trends confound the proxy they use to assess need.\n\nThese results suggest that the driving force behind the bias we detect is that Black patients generate lesser medical expenses, conditional on health, even when we account  for specific comorbidities. As a result, accurate prediction of costs  necessarily means being racially biased on health. First, poor patients face substantial barriers to accessing health care, even when enrolled in insurance plans. Although the population we study is entirely insured, there are many other mechanisms by which poverty  can lead to disparities in use of health care: geography and  differential access to transportation, competing demands from jobs or  child care, or knowledge of reasons to seek care. To the extent that race and socioeconomic status are correlated, these  factors will differentially affect Black patients.\n\nThe authors conclude \"On the one hand, the algorithm manufacturer’s choice to predict future  costs is reasonable: The program’s goal, at least in part, is to reduce  costs, and it stands to reason that patients with the greatest future  costs could have the greatest benefit from the program.\" But there is now much greater clarity on UnitedHealth's objectives, some possible design flaws have been exposed and hopefully this work has helped UnitedHealth improve their model to provide better service.\nThe Objections\nWhy might these companies push back against being transparent about how they\nrecommend content to users?\nObjection 1: Exploiting the System\nThe first thing some black box system advocates might say is that obfuscating the mechanisms used to select content to promote and demote is necessary to prevent spam and gaming the system. I think this argument fails on the same principles that security through obscurity fails. The fact that a system is not inspectable does not prevent this from being exploited. And folks operating recommendation systems have seen this first hand. As has been learned in infosec, more eyes and more pentesters makes systems more solid. And the easiest way to do that is to make the system open and transparent. We could have better, more fair, more exploitative proof systems if we do the work in the open.\nObjection 2: Value Proposition and The Caveat - Data Monopolies\nLikely, the next thing you might hear from an industry lobbyist regarding some sort of legislation requiring recommendation engine transparency would be \"This harms our competitive advantage\" i.e. that the reason a user or advertiser may choose Twitter over Mastodon is their recommendation system. This fundamentally mischaracterizes the value proposition of these services. An adequate recommendation system is required to be able to use these systems at scale, as not all posts or content are relevant or interesting to all people.\nHowever, the reason why these platforms are valuable is the network effects and data exclusivity of these platforms. They tend to be the one or two places on the internet to find particular types of content. On Instagram this might be your friends or influencers photos, on Twitter this may be some public figure's musings. Fundamentally, you use Twitter and not Mastodon because XYZ person is here and not there.\nFor advertisers this is similar. The vast majority of people's time is spent on one of a few websites. The value proposition to advertisers is, if you want eyeballs this is the best place on the web to find them. A recommendation system is one way to keep people on for longer per person, but this is marginal gains compared to acquiring a massive user base. As such these companies have realized that one of the most important things they can do is regulate access to this content for maximum leverage. I.e. in order to see your friends posts on Instagram, you must sign up, sign the EULA giving permission for whatever tracking the service provider wants to do, and log in. More and more these platforms are preventing their content from being indexed publicly or explored anonymously.\n\nThis is all in contrast to services like Google where all the content is public and the value proposition of the service is to find the most relevant results. For Google, their differentiation is in their recommendation engines performance because anyone can set up a web server and start ranking results. Therefore, if you think Google is unfair, use a different option. There is no alternative for Twitter or Facebook.\nSo social media companies control the data and control what data is shown. I argue that you should be able to have one or the other. Either your recommendation system can be private because your source data is public thus allowing competition in recommendations and the ability to audit the data or you can hoard data but you must be transparent on what you collect and how it is promoted or suppressed, thus clarifying the encoded values of the platform (like how Obermeyer et. al. clarifies what is valued in UnitedHealth's model). People can then make an informed decision on whether they agree or if the content available is worth the trade off. If someone is going to be the sole mediator of access to a particular type of data, I want to know what incentives are at play for deciding what is show and what is hidden.\nObjection 3: Embarrassment\nA ridiculous argument, yet honestly the most deeply held one. It's easier to not be transparent and not expose your dirty laundry, all the hacks and tricks used to recommend one piece of content over another (e.g. Elon, Democrat and Republican specific filters). But this seems like an unacceptable reason for people who's ambitions include being the main source of news and media for billions of people to not be transparent. Either reduce the scope of the product or be more open.\nMore and more content is being mediated. The days of the web being fully open are over and it seems like this trend will get worse. As this happens, platform owners take a more central role in deciding what is shown and what is suppressed. It therefore matters what the encoded values of these systems are. Letting people make these decisions behind closed doors without disclosing how they decide recommendations leaves us vulnerable. We would be relying on them to be strong moral arbiters, making ethical decisions and policy unilaterally that spans the whole world's political and cultural spectrum, a level of institutional power and responsibility that seems almost unrivaled and a position that they themselves would rather not be in.\nOpen recommendation systems allow people to be informed on platform values and incentives. Barring the alternative of forcing the data these companies hoard to be openly accessible (a radical yet, not terrible idea) so competitor recommendation systems can exist, being transparent benefits everyone. Users are more informed on why they are seeing this post and not that post or why their post has not garnered a lot of perceived interest, something which does cause people stress and anguish. Advertisers have more clarity on how their ads fit into the system. And, the companies can benefit from the insights of the greater open source community and are able to point to explicit code to explain their decisions.\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/twitter-algo/","title":"All Recommendation Engines Should Follow Twitter's Example on Transparency"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/waypoint-transformer/":{"body":"Waypoint Transformer\nThe Waypoint Transformer was published at NeuRIPS 2023 by Badrinath et. al. and is a new method for Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) that builds on the prior Decision Transformer and is conditioned on automatically generated waypoints.\nOnline vs Offline Reinforcement Learning\nIn reinforcement learning, the agent learns to interact with an environment by taking actions and observing the results. The agent's goal is to maximize the cumulative reward it receives over time. The agent learns by trial and error, exploring the environment and learning from its experiences. There are two large classes of approach to reinforcement learning: online and offline. Online reinforcement learning interacts with the environment in real-time, while offline reinforcement learning learns from collected prior experiences interacting with the environment.\nSupervised Reinforcement Learning (RvS)\nValue-based offline methods tend to attempt to learn a pessimistic value estimate for different states in the state space or state action pairs. This is used to estimate the expected return of a policy. Alternatively, model-based offline RL methods estimate the dynamics of the environment and use it to plan. Typically, complex hyperparameter tuning is required to achieve stable learning.\nReinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS), builds off behavioral cloning as a simple alternative to traditional offline RL. This removes the need for Temporal Difference (TD) learning and value functions and allows offline RL to reuse methods from supervised learning. Typically, the conditioning variable for the policy is based off the return, goal-conditioning, or inverse reinforcement learning,\nRvS has historically struggled in tasks where the agent must combine multiple sub-optimal training trajectories to achieve a goal. The Waypoint Transformer paper points to two notable examples: reaching specific locations in AntMaze and completing a series of tasks in FrankaKitchen. Here, prior TD methods such as Implicit Q-learning outperform RvS methods.\nWaypoint Transformer\nThe Waypoint Transformer introduces a method for generating intermediate goals and more stable proxy rewards that guide the policy towards objectives. Then they use a transformer based RvS method on the generated sub-goals to obtain a policy that learns to follow the waypoints improving performance and stability vs other offline RL methods.\nSetting\nUsing the Markov Decision Process (MDP) setting, with states $s_t \\in \\mathcal{S}$, $a_t \\in \\mathcal{A}$, unknown dynamics $p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$ and initial state distribution $p(s_0)$, the agent chooses an action $a_t \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t | s_{t-k..t}, \\Phi_{t-k..t})$, parameterized by $\\theta$ and conditioned on a known history of states $s_{t-k..t}$ and a conditioning variable $\\Phi_{t-k..t}$ that could encode goals or rewards based on a target global outcome $\\omega$.\nThis is distinct from the traditional RL setting where the policy is modeled on $\\pi(a_t | s_t)$, as the policy is modeled using a transformer which accepts the past states in a fixed sized context window $k$. The choice of $\\omega$ during training is sampled from data. At test time, it is assumed that $\\omega$ can be generated or provided by global goal information for a goal-conditioned variant or simply a target reward in the reward-conditioned variant.\nWaypoints\n\nIn offline RL, data typically does not encompass all possible cases that an agent may want to achieve in testing. Consider a infinite dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ that is collected by a random behavior policy $\\pi_{b}(a_t|s_t)$. When looking to achieve a goal $\\omega = s^{(H)}$, the random policy will be suboptimal since actions are selected at random. Then when using a goal conditioned policy $\\pi_{G}(a_t|s_t,\\omega)$ that is trained using demonstrations from $\\mathcal{D}$, the policy will also be suboptimal since $\\omega$ is fixed, so $\\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S},$ $\\pi_{G}(a_t|s_t,\\omega) = \\pi_{b}(a_t|s_t)$. So a global goal-conditioned policy cannot be any better than the random behavior policy it was trained on.\nInstead consider a policy that uses intermediate goals $\\pi_{W}(a_t|s_t, \\Phi_t)$, $\\Phi_t = s_{t+k}$. The paper shows that the probability of choosing an optimal action is higher compared to the longer-horizon goal conditioned policy. $\\Phi_t$ also serves as a guide as it guides the policy towards strong intermediate targets to reach the global goal. As long as the selected waypoints are strong ones that lead towards the goal $\\omega$, the expectation on policy will be more optimal than behavior cloning.\nStitching Waypoints\n\nThe ability to compose sequences of otherwise suboptimal trajectories requires finding experiences that are more relevant to achieving subgoals vs the overall goal. The paper uses AntMaze to demonstrate this. They find that only 5% of trajectories using a random policy (this is unclear in the paper) would demonstrate how to cross between a start region and the target region. It is therefore very unlikely to find a trajectory that goes from the start state to the goal state. The policy must stitch together trajectories that start at the start state with trajectories that end at the goal state. By providing waypoints in the stitching regions the policy can be guided to connect the relevant sub-sequences together.\nGenerating Waypoints (Goal-conditioned RvS)\nThe paper uses a waypoint generator that makes $k$ step ahead predictions of future observations conditioned on $s_t$ and $\\omega$. This is parameterized as a neural network that is trained on the same offline dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ as the policy using MSE loss.\n$$\narg\\min_{\\phi} \\sum_{(s_t, \\omega) \\in \\mathcal{D}} || W_{\\phi}(s_t, \\omega) - s_{t+k} ||^2_2\n$$\nBy doing this you are learning which states $k$ steps ahead you want to visit to reach a goal $\\omega$ and then use this to guide the policy. The assumption is that you will have a strong demonstration of the policies to cross $k$ steps from any particular state to other states $k$ steps away.\nGenerating Proxy Rewards (Reward-conditioned RvS)\nPrior methods use cumulative reward to-go (CRTG) - a dynamic estimate of the reward to go or average reward-to-go (ARTG) - a static estimate of the reward to go as proxy rewards for the policy. However, using these conditioning variables has drawbacks: the variance of cumulative reward-to-go is high and the bias of the average reward-to-go is high. Instead of using a learned value function like in TD methods, this paper adds a reward waypoint network to estimate both cumulative and average reward-to-go conditioned on $s_t$ and $\\omega$ using $\\mathcal{D}$. They claim that modeling both CRTG and ARTG addresses the high bias of ARTG and the high variance of CRTG in the same way that prior methods like REINFORCE do.\nPolicy Transformer\n\nThe architecture for the waypoint transformer is based on GPT-2. The policy is conditioned on the past $k$ states and the waypoints (either the goals or rewards) $\\Phi_{t - k..t}$ which are generated by the waypoint network. The policy transformer is trained using negative log likelihood loss based on data sampled from $\\mathcal{D}$. During this process, the waypoint network is fixed. Unlike decision transformers, the waypoint transformer is not conditioned on past actions.\nExperiments\nThe proposed method is evaluated on two environments that come with many suboptimal demonstrations in the goal-conditioned case: AntMaze and FrankaKitchen. FrankaKitchen specifically has no end to end demonstrations available. For each of these environments, the paper uses goal conditioning where $\\omega = s_{target}$ and constructs intermediate waypoints using the goal waypoint network. For reward-conditioned tasks they use Gym-MuJoCo. For a plurality of evaluated tasks, waypoint transformers outperform decision transformers and other offline RL methods. However there are some cases where TD still outperforms the waypoint transformer or that waypoint transformer simply matches the performance of behavior cloning.\n\nThe authors analyze the behavior of the waypoint transformer on AntMaze, they find that WT is much more effective at reaching the goal state than a globally conditioned policy and completes the task faster. When using $k = 30$ vs. $k = 0$, the performance is 2.2x worse.\nOn reward conditioned tasks the authors analyze the behavior of the waypoint transformer on Hopper-v2. They find that the standard deviation of CRTG grows slower than other methods. WT is also more robust to the choice of seed than other methods.\nInterestingly in the appendix, they evaluated using manually selected waypoints and found that WT outperforms manual waypoints. However the manual waypoints are still better than no waypoints and the difference seems to come down to the density of waypoints selected. The manual waypoints are much coarser than the waypoints selected by the waypoint network.\nWhy This Matters\nThe real usefulness of this method is to be able to collect a lot of partial demonstrations of relevant trajectories, then allow the waypoint network guide the policy to compose them together to achieve a goal in an environment with sparse rewards where traditional RL methods would struggle or would require much higher quality data. RvS is a compelling method for RL since it does not require learning a value function which is incredibly sensitive to initialization and requires a lot of data to learn. The issue with prior RvS methods is that they rely on the quality of the demonstrations to be able to learn a good policy. Behavior cloning and imitation learning methods alone are unable to utilize partial demonstrations as well, requiring demonstrations that fully explain how to achieve a goal. This makes data collection incredibly expensive and time consuming particularly when goal and start states are not fixed. Waypoint transformers demonstrate a method to learn from partial demonstrations and compose them together to achieve a goal. However, waypoint transformers are a method designed to handle degenerate cases. In cases where demonstrations are complete, waypoint transformers are not necessary and their performance will be similar to behavior cloning or decision transformers. This paper focuses on spatial composability and reward interpolation, it is unclear how well waypoint transformers are able to compose over other dimensions such as skill chaining.\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/waypoint-transformer/","title":"Understanding the Waypoint Transformer"},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/web-directory/":{"body":"\nDumping Facebook\nSophomore year of college I started becoming more aware of the all the data I was posting online, mostly because I realized how much time I was spending on Facebook in the first place. Before it was on the first page of my home screen on my phone and always opened in a browser tab. Whenever I had a free moment on the bus or an empty URL bar in the browser I would find myself moving to hit the 'f' icon, or typing 'f' in to the URL bar without thinking and end up aimlessly scrolling Facebook.  Once I realized it, I started to consider why I used Facebook, what was I getting out of it and also what was the true cost of using the service? In middle and high school I did things like backfilling all the places I've been, where I worked, what my interests were and more out of some sense of completion. But, now I was wondering, why does everyone (and Facebook) need to know that I went to Botswana and really like the All Blacks and Bill Nye the Science Guy?\nAt this time skepticism regarding Facebook was increasing, I was starting to notice reports about tracking pixels, reports of experimentation on users without consent, the addition of the M assistant in Messenger and some of the dark patterns associated with the like button (obviously this sort of criticism really took off after the election of Trump). I was also looking more into \"Big Data\" as they referred to what Facebook was doing then as I was diving deeper into my work on Computer Vision and Machine Learning.  As I learned more about what is required to develop effective systems like the ones Facebook was making and especially the incentives that Facebook has to design systems in particular ways, I grew a lot more wary of them and similar services on the internet (Instagram, TicTok, etc.). The straw that broke the camels back was this paper from Prof. Karahalios group at UIUC “I always assumed that I wasn’t really that close to [her]”:Reasoning about invisible algorithms in the news feed\" which poignantly raises questions about the effects these recommendation engines have on us (and if we notice at all).\nBut Facebook has it's uses. First of all its a great facebook, an index of people you know. By extension it's a really powerful local organizing tool and messaging platform. These are the features that Facebook touts as it tries to posture itself as a force for good and they are right because it's a unique feature of their platform. And this is why I haven't \"gone off the grid\" and deactivated my account, especially while I was in college organizing things. But I have significantly curtailed my use and limit it to the features that truly have the best exchange rate between the utility and the costs.  So I still have Messenger installed on my phone for the random message I need to send / receive from someone I talked to last 3 years ago and until Facebook got rid of the Events app (and replaced it with a recommender app for local events) I had that too. But I have a strong preference not to use Messenger and most conversations that go long enough get ported to Wire, Signal, maybe Telegram or if necessary iMessage/SMS.\nHowever these aren't the core uses of Facebook for many people. The core use is the News Feed. To its credit, it really is an effective discovery method for new content especially about your friends. However, as has become abundantly clear (shown by Prof. Karahalios and others), content is not shown to you purely because it might be relevant or interesting to you. Eslami et al. shows that $&gt; 50% $ of respondents in the study were previously unaware that there was a curation model operating the News Feed. \"[They also] found participants often attributed missing stories to their friends’ decisions to exclude them rather than to Facebook News Feed algorithm.\" Social media companies like other curators have their own motives for showing or suppressing content. Where these motives align with your interest, you have a healthy symbiosis. For example, if I'm looking to buy a new bike, seeing potentially paid advertising for a bike might actually be pretty nice. Or a cool story on the EF Education First team was written in Bicycle Magazine that the magazine promoted. Or just making the service useful enough to keep you on the platform consuming ads would be a worthwhile tradeoff. But a lot of times irrelevant or erroneous content is shown because it's paid for in the most charitable case, in the more sinister case, its promoted in a faustian bargain to further increase user engagement on the platform, i.e. Facebook looks to illicit a reaction, positive or negative (it doesn't matter) over providing relevant or informative content in a bid to get you to keep coming back. After falling for a couple instances of disinformation being promoted on Facebook, it became clear this is not a reasonable way to get news.\nAlternative forms of curation on the Internet\nSo how does one get news without a recommendation engine? Very millennial / Gen Z question I know. One can try the newsy subreddits of Reddit. Reddit doesn't use an recommender model, it uses the opinions of its users to promote or hide content. I found myself aimlessly scrolling it to waste time on Reddit too, so I uninstalled that app as well. But one again, there are also concerns about if the aggregate opinion of Reddit is an effective way to rank news or content. Similar to how Facebook has an incentive to promote incendiary content because it's more engaging, the promotion of content on Reddit is based on a measure of how engaging it is. So again without the pressures of decorum, nuance and factual accuracy enforced in real life, you end up seeing the id of society embodied on reddit. The things that are most popular on Reddit are things that make you super happy (/r/aww, /r/wholesomememes, etc.) or make you super angry (/r/PublicFreakout, /r/IdiotsInCars and /r/trashy) (https://redditmetrics.com/) or some other strong emotion. Other link aggregators (HackerNews etc.) have the similar problems.\nSo if you can't use a model that you don't control and you can't use the crowd, what about the old fashioned way - Editorial Boards of reputable publications? After getting rid of Reddit on my phone too, for the next few years I mostly frequented between a couple tech sites and common news sources, essentially websites I committed to muscle\nmemory or that were on my bookmarks toolbar. However, for whatever journalists say about their moral responsibility, in the end they also publish to satisfy their own ends and the work is curated by a few on the editorial board. By wholly relying on one or a few sources, you are left in the same position you would be using Facebook, albeit at a different scale. Fox News is the most obvious example of this happening, but the same would happen if I only read the Jacobin or CNN or MSNBC. You can try to diversify, but I found that its a lot harder to habit form frequenting a broad range of sites over just going to the first couple sites on your home page or bookmarks bar.\nA Theory of Curation for the Internet\nSo how do you solve this problem? You could demand Facebook, Reddit or the New York Times change, but its' unclear how successful you'd be given the things they would be potentially giving up. Is the answer tear down all curation and muddle your way through it all yourself? No. The web needs curation, don't take the rejection of managed feeds or editorial boards as a some sign that we don't. There are millions of exabytes of data out there, people need help parsing through it. Google is great for when you know what specifically you're looking for. But if you have just a vague notion of a topic or no idea and just want compelling content, it's much more effective to use someone else's expertise as a filter.\nThe issue with curation as it is right now is that agency has been taken from the user (by their own choice to be clear) and they have become purely a consumer. In exchange for not expending much effort to get a wide variety of selected \"interesting and relevant\" content, you have little to no recourse when it comes to what you see and how it's shown to you. The level of input you have is explicitly declaring your interests to the service (subscribing to subreddits or liking sources), interactions with the site (which are tracked), explicit \"like/dislike\" buttons or complaining to maybe nudge the engine one way or another. A great example of this lack of agency is the anxiety people feel when it comes to clicking on a weird video, not because they aren't curious about it but because it might screw up their YouTube recommendations. This seems fundamentally broken.\nAggregators as well whether they are Facebook, Reddit or the New York Times aim to abstract away the content producer from the feed. It's beneficial to them if you do not notice the difference between a long form New Yorker piece and a quiz from BuzzFeed or an article from a wire service from one researched for years by the investigative reporting staff. It keeps you on their site, consuming their ads. But in doing that you lose the advantages that come with curators, why you'd want one in the first place. A good curator, has a consistent voice and a domain of expertise and by extension a context that their arguments are presented in. By using the New York Times, Facebook or Reddit as your \"broker\" for content from content \"wholesalers\" you lose context in addition to the loss in agency.\nNesting Doll of Curators\n\nThe best example of a healthy ecosystem of curation is podcasts. For podcasts, you don't have a generic feed of content ordered by a third party, you have a collection of feeds, each curated by one or a few people that end up coalescing into a customized feed for each person. When looking for podcasts we don't look for specific episodes we care about from a generic feed, we look for good voices who over time produce interesting and varied content. We are essentially trying to collect a set of curators who in aggregate give you a broad and diverse view of the world, each of them bringing a different experience and expertise to the table. The onus is now on you, the consumer, when it comes to podcasts to construct a feed that represents the breath of topics and perspectives you want to see, not anyone else. If you want to create a close minded eco-chamber, that's your prerogative but you chose that feed not anyone else.\nUnbeknownst to many, the way podcasts work is based on the open standard RSS. Content producers attach a generic feed to their website which RSS Readers can use to get a list of content published that day. RSS fell out of favor with the death of Google Reader and gradually people adopting Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. But what it did have was a similar curation model to podcasts. People chose what to subscribe to and were delivered all content from those subscriptions. From there they can choose how to filter through that feed.\nIt's easy enough to set up an RSS feed that just shows you the postings of the day or if you're ambitious you can take it further. There's a whole bunch of clients you can use, I use Reeder4 on my mac and phone (https://reederapp.com/), and I have a shared feed in a discord server I am in using a bot we made which posts the new posts every morning (https://github.com/the-round-table/trtbot). The beauty of RSS is it gives you a mechanism to diversify the sources you're exposed to without the additional cognitive load. The issue you face without RSS is to remember to check out all of those sources. This is not an issue if you automatically poll all the sources you've written down as interesting.  As to my usage patterns issue, which started this journey, it has the benefit of being based around pulls (i.e. you need to ask for more content for more content to show), and inherently limited by the content being published, so you can't build the habit of endlessly refreshing the page to get more content.\nBut both Podcasts and RSS are based around multiple levels of curation, there is curation in the sources and this is done by the user, and there is curation in each source, done by the source themselves. The user has the ability to change the sources they see at their will but will need to go through all the content sources put out. The nice thing is that they get to choose what metrics are used to organize content. It gives the user recourse to change the feed as they like while also benefiting from the value curators provide.\nRSS is not a complete solution however. The key flaw (that curated feeds are really good at and is probably why people switched) is the discovery of the new is really hard with RSS by itself. RSS is static with regard to sources. So while some cool new source might appear on Reddit or Facebook because someone else frequents that site, you'll never find it if you're not looking it. It's easy enough to continue to use Reddit, Facebook, Twitter or HackerNews and remain vigilant for new sources which you add to your RSS feed, but these are stochastic events based on Reddit, Facebook etc. catching your interest and may draw you back into the algorithmic or crowd feed fold.\nThe Web Directory\nTurns out this too was solved previously, coming from a time before Web 2.0 or even Google. How do you find cool places on the web if you don't have a search engine or you don't know what you're looking for? How do you know what's even out there on the Web? With a directory of course! When the internet was small enough that all the important websites could fit on a page or a few, websites like yahoo.com served as the phone book of the internet, categorizing cool or interesting sites so that people could find their way around.\nSo the practice was if I was looking for a website on rugby or just interesting place to go, I'd go to yahoo.com and just look in the sport section for relevant sounding websites. People also maintained their own personal lists (called web hotlists) containing their discoveries on the web. So if I'm looking for interesting places on the web, I can hop to a buddy's website and see what they were reading.\nI believe this is the missing piece to make self crafted feeds (via RSS or some other protocol) relevant as a method to find and discover new content. There needs to be ways to explore and discover new sources. Podcasts do this in a wide variety of ways; they cross promote themselves, apps have special discovery views, but the best way (in terms of how many podcasts I've liked from this method) I believe has been word of mouth, i.e. the curation of sources from people whose opinions I already respect.  I think this is a practice that needs to comeback (with RSS) as part of the infrastructure to live a recommendation feed free life. In order for people to be able to effectively use RSS to find content on the internet, there needs to easy ways to explore what is out there at the source level. Allowing others to benefit from your exploration through a directory is an easy way to develop this infrastructure. There is a similar old idea I've seen pop up again called Web Rings, which is a group of self referential websites. Members of the ring will link to other members, either to drive traffic towards them or to optimize for SEO. A pretty cool one is this one from XXIIVV webring.xxiivv.com. Regardless of how you do it though, the support must be out there for people so they can make decisions about what they want to see themselves.\nSo as a step in this direction, I'm putting up my own Web Directory. Its pretty plain right now (I may attach a formated OPML file with the entries so its easy to import into a RSS reader later UPDATE: You can now find an OPML file with all the sources here), but it includes a list of the websites, youtube channels and podcasts I enjoy. I may add other formats to this, but the rule I'm keeping to is the source must either be a website or consumable by RSS (or both). I hope that you do the same and if you do you should tweet me or whatever other form of communication you prefer @narendasan. I'd love to see it, I'm always looking for more content.\n\nPost Script (Twitter &amp; YouTube)\nSo even though I basically got rid of Facebook as a news feed and I frequent a few specific subreddits, I still have a couple recommendation engines in my life, YouTube and Twitter.\nYouTube is an interesting case. Video is not cheap to host, especially compared to a website. And there is no GitHub pages for Video (yet). So there is structural pressure to upload to a service (this centralizes video on a few sites). The additional pressures to actually make a living of content creation, further centralizes video on the one or two services that have that yield the most revenue, for short form video this is YouTube. I don't know how to change this. There are some alternatives (PeerTube, FloatPlane etc.) but for now YouTube is the home of video on the internet, and as much as I want to make decisions for myself, I'd much rather watch the guys at Mahalo My Dude or Squidge Rugby. So I resort to trying to use the subscriptions tab when I remember to still maintain as much control over what I'm seeing as possible. But by default you are given an recommendation feed and so there is cognitive load associated with switching over (you can intentionally make the recommendation feed less helpful to aid in this cognitive load by telling Youtube to not track history and set your region to some where else). But people may not know or may have forgotten that there is actually RSS support for youtube channels, so you may be able to bypass the YouTube recommendation engine that way.\nHow to subscribe to YouTube Channels over RSS\nGet RSS updates for a single channel\nTo get an RSS feed of a single channel’s uploads, paste the channel URL into your RSS reader.\n\nThis seems to only work for channels associated with Users on YouTube (look for /user/ in the url to tell the difference)\n\nYou can subscribe to \"channel channels\" by finding the external channel id in the URL and using this URL template\nhttps://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID\n\nSo for Royal Ocean Film Society who's url is https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWq-qJSudqKrzquTVep9Jwg, the RSS feed would be https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCWq-qJSudqKrzquTVep9Jwg\nYou can also subscribe to specific playlist similarly using the following template\nhttps://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PLAYLIST_ID\n\nSo to subscribe to all the It's Alive (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKtIunYVkv_SUyXj_6Fe53okfzM9yVq1F) videos from Bon Appetit, you would use https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PLKtIunYVkv_SUyXj_6Fe53okfzM9yVq1F\nGet RSS updates for all subscriptions\nTo import all your YouTube subscriptions to your RSS reader, you can use our OPML file download feature:\n\nDownload the OPML file by clicking Export subscriptions at the bottom of your Manage Subscriptions page. This will download a file named \"subscription_manager.xml\".\nImport the OPML file in your RSS reader.\n\nIn Feedly, for example, this can be found in Organize in the left panel, then Import OPML.\n\n\n\nFor Twitter, again I feel the issue is that the format is unique. Not everyone has a blog, but \"everyone\" has a Twitter account. Especially for academia, I probably would not hear about a good percentage of the work in ML/DL that I would be interested in without Twitter. My solution here is to strongly prefer the use of self curated lists as well as setting the main feed to \"Latest Tweets show up as they happen\", which avoids the cognitive load you need to deal with on YouTube. I also to avoid the use issues I had with Facebook and Reddit don't install the Twitter app on my phone. I manage feeds of accounts for Academia, Tech, Open Source, Sports, Colorado and more. So ultimately I end up treating like I treat my RSS feed, mostly check them about once a day.\nHow to set your timeline to latest tweets\n\n\nClick on the sparkle ✨\n\n\n\nSelect \"See latest Tweets instead\"\n\n\n\nNow you should see the feed chronologically\n\n\n\n\nNote the fine print though \"You'll be switched back to Home after you've been away for a while\" its unclear how this really works and when you will be switched back, here is what Twitter said\n\n\n","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/web-directory/","title":"Naren's Web Directory"},"https://www.narendasan.com/dir/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/dir/","title":"Directory"},"https://www.narendasan.com/photos/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/photos/","title":"Photos"},"https://www.narendasan.com/pubs/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/pubs/","title":"Publications"},"https://www.narendasan.com/rps/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/rps/","title":"Reposts"},"https://www.narendasan.com/teaching/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.narendasan.com/teaching/","title":"Teaching"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.narendasan.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://www.narendasan.com/about/":{"body":322,"title":0},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/3dfs/":{"body":332,"title":10},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/ab-hackathon/":{"body":29,"title":2},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/acm-gpu-cluster/":{"body":427,"title":3},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/amorphous-facade/":{"body":568,"title":8},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/arbor/":{"body":1003,"title":3},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/chatgpt-web/":{"body":1229,"title":8},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/cs196/":{"body":295,"title":5},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/digits-of-e/":{"body":1868,"title":8},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/dl4agx/":{"body":73,"title":7},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/ekko/":{"body":357,"title":4},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/hackillinois2017/":{"body":6135,"title":1},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/open-weave/":{"body":2025,"title":6},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/peter-pan/":{"body":494,"title":5},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/pokemon-clip/":{"body":1766,"title":5},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/procgen-terrain/":{"body":1706,"title":6},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/tedxmilehigh/":{"body":22,"title":3},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/tensorrt-python-api/":{"body":1089,"title":3},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/trtorch/":{"body":1991,"title":6},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/twilight/":{"body":423,"title":1},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/twitter-algo/":{"body":1213,"title":6},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/waypoint-transformer/":{"body":990,"title":3},"https://www.narendasan.com/blog/web-directory/":{"body":1846,"title":3},"https://www.narendasan.com/dir/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.narendasan.com/photos/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.narendasan.com/pubs/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.narendasan.com/rps/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.narendasan.com/teaching/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":30},"lang":"English"};
