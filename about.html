  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! My name is Naren. I grew up in Colorado, did my undergrad out in the cornfields
    of central Illinois and now am currently in San Fransisco working on the development
    of self driving cars.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    I've worked on topics ranging from climate modeling, high performace computing, design,
    computer vision and systems (web, distributed, embedded and operating or some combination
    of those) but since I was in high school I have most passionate about thinking about and
    developing the interactions between one or many people and one or many robots (i.e. human
    robot interaction, swarm robotics, multi agent systems, and artifical intellegence). Hence
    a good amount of my academic work is centered around these ideas.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    I am also an advocate for Free and Open Source Software and Hardware. During my
    undergrad, I, along with a couple close collaborators worked on extending the ideas
    of the hackathon craze of the 2010s to address getting more students involved in the
    open source community. This resulted in HackIllinois becoming (to my knowledge) the
    first open source collegiate hackathon. Growing from a small pilot program to 1000+
    attendees a year, over the last 4 years 100s of Pull Requests, a few releases, and a
    whole lot of cool new open source projects and forks were created at Hackillinois, a
    lot done by first time open source contributors being mentored by core maintainers of
    projects like Debian, Rust, WebAssembly, Python, Julia and more.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    In my free time I'm an avid mountain biker (and road biker too I guess) as well as like
    to play tennis, soccer and rugby (got a few caps for Illinois while I was there). I was
    chair of the UIUC Chapter of ACM from 2016-2017, ACM@UIUC being the nations largest ACM
    student chapter and during my time there I created quite a few projects that ACM now
    maintain. 
  </p>

    Now I work at NVIDIA developing preception and other deep learning components for autonomous
    vehicles within the contraints of the resource limited enviorment of a car. I therefore
    use TensorRT a lot and ended up creating the TensorRT Python API (something that the
    TensorRT team now maintains and has vastly improved from its original verisons) and worked on
    the open sourcing effort for TensorRT. You can see a hint of the perception work we do by
    looking at NVIDIA's DevBlog.
