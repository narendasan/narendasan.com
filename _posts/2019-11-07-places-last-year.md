# Where I've Been in the Last Year (and a Half)

> Thought now that I've finished my first year out of my undergrad it's worth checking in every so often. Hopefully I keep up checking in at least yearly.

## May 2018 

May marks the end of college and now figuring out what life outside just school will look like (though I suspect it will not be the last time I'm in school). Literally the day after graduation, I headed off on a month long tour of Europe, with the family. 

### Iceland 

A cliche to be sure, but one that is entirely worth doing anyway. While a lot has been said about the picturesque landscapes and the desolute nature of Iceland, the built enviorment cannot be overlooked as well.



The food we had in Iceland obviously stemmed from the New Nordic movement currently in vouge in many places in the world. The most notable place was Fiskmarkadurinn, (you need to see their website, its something else https://www.fiskmarkadurinn.is/). This place was a seafood focused New Nordic resturant where you can get Atlantic Char Crostini and I got the salted Cod, both of which I still think about.  

Architecture



### Amsterdam

Being interested in urban design and throughly been doused with commentary on US urban planning and its shortcomings compared to Europe, Amsterdam being a particular example of how to do it right, I have to say that people are entirely right. Teslas serve as taxis at the airport (though I feel this is mostly for show). Just the bicycle infrastructure alone is the envy of most cities in the US (I'd say Boulder is an exception, but this is at an entirely different scale). We were able rent some bikes and ride around town and it's a completely different experience to riding back home. It's eerily close to driving in traffic except people are riding at 15mph instead 40. This is key though, being someone not familiar with the dutch etiquette, I did get into a couple of the biking equivalent of near misses driving, but when you're moving at 15 mph, all this is is a sorry and a wavy and moving on. Being able to pedal along the canals and duck through side streets in Amsterdam was great because there isn't a second thought given to traffic most of the time because of the raised medians between cars and bike lanes and the clear bicycle specific signaling. San Fransisco is trying a similar signaling system but its wildly confusing as its thrown on the side of select lights and otherwise cyclists are either treated like pedestrians or traffic depending on the light. In my opinion, unless you have dedicated systems its safest to treat cyclists as pedestrians (ala most of Boulder) but this seems to be less common. 

We also were able to venture out side of the city center to a converted industrial area which became an Art space + Food Hall. 

### Zurich 

Zurich is another example of fantastic urban planning. Here the star was public trasportation. Being based in Universitrass, getting to the city center and central train station HB, took a single tram which runs every few minutes. (This article talks all about Zurichs transportation system). Zurich also has a massive underground bike parking lot under HB and a complementary bike rental program so again getting around town is trival. I also had a chance to check out ETH Zurich,



We got out of the city to experience the Swiss Alps and coming from the Rocky Mountains it was something else, completely green and lots of lakes and rivers. 

### Italy (Lake Como, Venice, Florence, Rome)

The maze of bridges and paths in Venice are truely unique. I think though one of the draw backs of Venice is because its so contained and famous, it is packed with tourists. This doesn't get in the way of the experience necessarily, but I think you do need to be a bit more careful about how you chose to spend your time. Its very easy to get caught in tourist traps. 

Florence was my favorite city we visted in Italy. The city center was extremely walkable, and this allows you to stumble accross all sort of facinating buildings and landmarks. Of course we checked out . I also liked the food the most in general in Florence, Tuscan style pastas and   

Rome was interesting from a historical perspective and the fact I had tak

The single best meal I had in Italy was in Rome in a small lunch spot we stumbled across. Expecting to grab a quick bite before our flight to London we instead found ourselves eating a 5 course seafood feast. The most interesting dish was a smoked and aged tuna which was treated like pruchitto. 



## June 2018

After the month in Europe, we headed back state side. I spent a week at home in Colorado where I bought my first full suspension bike in prepration to go to Whister, which I shipped off to Seattle before heading back to Urbana to pack up my apartment. This also gave me a chance to drop by all my favorite spots one last time. 

### Urbana, IL 

#### Cafe & Co (Formally Flying Machine)

I think that everyone coming to college has a settling-in period, one of the things that it took me a bit to get used to was not having a place similar to Pearl St. where you weren't surrounded by just college students and so the first time I went to downtown Urbana and went to Flying Machine with some friends, it was a game changer, from then I had some place where if I wanted to escape being a college student for a couple hours i could. Their space was incredibly well designed with a mix of communal tables and smaller ones, the coffee was really good + their hours were amazing for someone who likes having a nice space outside of the apartment or the ECE department to do work. It closing was a bummer but at least it lives on in Avionics. Cafe & Co at least maintained the vibe and space (and introduced Nitro Cold Brew,) so thats cool.

#### Broadway Food Hall 

This space was weird, I first stumbled on it because of their Wing Night and it quickly became a weekly tradition (it was a good thing I was in Urbana on a Thrusday).

#### Sip Yard

### Seattle, WA

Seattle is a really cool city, I have yet to experience the gray cloudy skys and misting rain so all I know is sunny days and temperate weather. 

### Whistler, BC

This is a mecca of bike park riding, probably the most well known one and one that established the market for summer activities at ski resorts. Lift access downhill while it feels like cheating is a great way to fill the day with riding and still be wanting more. I think there were three notable trails we hit here, Samurai Pizza Cat, which unlike what Whister is known for is a tech trail with some cool wooden features, (I almost ate it here trying to transfer between some wooden bridges), Una Moss - B-Line, and Delayed Fuse, which was my first time hitting a freshly cut loam trail and also the trail I crashed on the most (something like 10 times in a run). 

Even though the bike park is what draws people in, there are some gems outside the bike park. We hit a twisty blue trail on blackhom mountain, which felt pretty similar to the types of trails I rode up in Nederland (with more trees) and was a great way to knock off 4 years of rust. 



### Vancouver, BC

Growing up in the mountains riding your bike on tiny trails to school every day then going to college in a place that very literally has one hill (which I only found a month before graduation) makes you really appreciative of the outdoors. There are very few places in the world that make the outdoors as accessible as Vancouver, BC. The crown jewel is the North Shore which has been completely covered in downhill mountain bike trails. And its not like converted fire roads or gravel trails, These are dedicated single track mountain bike trails that snake down the three mountains on the North Shore complete with handcrafted wooden (North Shore) features and granite rock rolls.  

These people are crazy, a blue trail in BC in most other places in the world would be a black. My favorite trail on the North Shore is Espresso (probably not an uncommon opinion), which is probably the most accessible Black Trail on Mt. Froome. This trail gives you a taste of everything the North Shore is known for, some jumps, a few skinnies, lots of wooden bridges and loam. Its worth shouting out NSMB who are the mountain bike alliance in Vancouver and the work they do maintain these trails 

Vancouver itself is a wonderful city, reasonably easy to get around, great food and coffee and a very cool library downtown. I think notable places for me here is the Stanley Park, Musette Coffee Shop, and Gastown. 

### Bay Area, CA 



Santa Cruz 





## November 2018 

### Seattle, WA

### Dublin

One of the highlights of College was heading up to Chicago to see the All Blacks play in the US for the first time in 100 years. The following year they returned for what will go down as one of the most legendary games in Irish Rugby history. So we went to Dublin to see the All Blacks get pay back and were throughly disappointed 

Coincedntally the Irish National Team 



Cemtented Ireland as a team I will root for (unless its against the All Blacks or now against Japan)



## December 2018

### Santiago / Val Parisso 

### Patagonia 

Patagoinia is absurd. I think this is all that can be said. Its unbelievable that there is such a space that is so picturesque that I can take a photo and not feel completely bad saying "This looks like an Ansel Adams". I think the photos also don't do the landscape any sort of justice, you just have to go there and experience it yourself. Barring doing the full hike or riding your bike, the way we travelled just made the experience even better. We rented a car from, and drove up to Porto Nateles, then drove into Torres Del Paine. In an effort not retread steps we decided to take a small access road into the park. This turned out to be a half paved a dirt road across rolling hills. Driving those roads might not necessarily fun but you get a unique set of views. We then went "classic view;,". We almost decided not to take the hike to the three amigos view point, but this ended up being the highlight of the day. Heading back we conecidentlaly hit golden hour on the way back and the skys cleared up. 



Porto Natales is a town of _ people, there are _ resutrants, we walked into a sort of cabin style resturant and was treated to one of the most unexpectedly incredible meals Ive had. 



## Feburary 2019 

### Urbana, IL 

#### Blind Pig 

#### V Picasso

#### Watsons 

## June 2019

### Colorado

I went back home to ride RIde the Rockies in June, 10 years since the last time I did and coencidentally a very similar route. 

#### Gunnison / Crested Butte

The first day of Ride the Rockies was a loop, I think this was the funnest day of riding.

#### Aspen

We rode from Buena Vista to Aspen over Independence Pass. I don't remember the last time being so hard. We spent 2 hours in the wind on the ride to the base of the mountain, saw the mountain still covered in snow and preceded to assend, 

#### Grand Junction

Instead of rehashing the grind back to Gunnison from Hotchkiss from 10 years earlier, which was memorable because all it was was riding in the wind, we pealed off and went to Grand Junction. 

## August 2019 

### Beijing

I've been to quite a few of the World Wonders (Machu Pichuu, the Pyramids, Ankor Wat) I think Machu Pichuu and the Great Wall are the only two that really hold up to the hype. 

## September 2019 

### Tokyo 

I went to Tokyo to hope to see my personal All Blacks losing streak be broken.
