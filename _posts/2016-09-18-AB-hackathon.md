In 2016 interestingly enough Anheuser Busch sponsored a hackathon in the ECE Department. At the time I started working
in [Prof. Tim Bretl's Lab](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/) on robotic grasping research and our lab had a Baxter from Rethink Robotics. A few labmates and I thought
it would be fun to turn it into a bartender.
