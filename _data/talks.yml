- title: "Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks"
  description: "What is a convolutional neural network and why have I been hearing so much about it? What do people really mean by
                  AI  and Machine Learning. How does it work, how can I build one and what can they do? These are the questions this tutorial
                  looks to begin to answer."

- title: "Intro to Convolutional Neural Nets and Implications of Deep Learning and AI"
  description: "Artificial Intelligence has entered a great age of productivity, with massive strides in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Task Learning being enabled by the exponential growth in data availability and the computing power enabled by General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing. Developers can now create near state of the art AI applications on their laptops. This talk will cover one of the main tools in deep learning and AI: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), how to build one, and how to apply it to a problem like handwriting recognition. It will then explore some of the current problems and approaches in the field of AI such as self driving cars, machine translation, and robotics."

- title: "Navigating Learning in the Multidisciplinary World"
  description: "What skills are necessary to succeed in a world that's becoming more and more complex? Is it better to specialize, focusing on one subject area? Or is it better to have an inter-disciplinary approach? Why the future of work lies not within specialization, but in the ability to draw on design thinking and immediate problem solving to solve the world's big challenges."
