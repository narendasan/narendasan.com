- title: "TRTorch: A Compiler for TorchScript Targeting NVIDIA GPUs with TensorRT"
  description: "We present TRTorch, a compiler for PyTorch and TorchScript targeting NVIDIA GPUs, which combines the usability of PyTorch with the performance of TensorRT allowing users to optimize easily inference workloads on NVIDIA GPUs. For experimentation and the development of machine learning models, few tools are as approachable as PyTorch. However, some of the features that make PyTorch great for development make it hard to deploy. With TorchScript, PyTorch now has solid tooling for addressing some of these problems. TorchScript removes the dependency on Python and produces portable, self contained, static representations of code and weights. In addition to portability, users also look to optimize performance in deployment. On NVIDIA GPUs, TensorRT, NVIDIAâ€™s deep learning optimizer, provides the capability to maximize performance of workloads by tuning the execution of models for specific target hardware. TRTorch merges the benefits of TorchScript and TensorRT to simplify conducting optimization including post training quantization by leveraging common PyTorch tooling. It can be used directly from PyTorch as a TorchScript Backend, via CLI or embedded (C++/Python) in an application to easily increase inference performance."

- title: "3DFS: deformable dense depth fusion and segmentation for object reconstruction from a handheld camera"
  description: "We propose an approach for 3D reconstruction and segmentation of a single object placed on a flat surface from an input video. Our approach is to perform dense depth map estimation for multiple views using a proposed objective function that preserves detail. The resulting depth maps are then fused using a proposed implicit surface function that is robust to estimation error, producing a smooth surface reconstruction of the entire scene. Finally, the object is segmented from the remaining scene using a proposed 2D-3D segmentation that incorporates image and depth cues with priors and regularization over the 3D volume and 2D segmentations. We evaluate 3D reconstructions qualitatively on our Object-Videos dataset, comparing to fusion, multiview stereo, and segmentation baselines. We also quantitatively evaluate the dense depth estimation using the RGBD Scenes V2 dataset [Henry et al. 2013] and the segmentation using keyframe annotations of the Object-Videos dataset."

- title: "Gesture based distributed user interaction system for a reconfigurable self-organizing smart wall"
  description: "We describe user interactions with the self-organized amorphous wall, a modular, fully distributed system of computational building blocks that communicate locally for creating smart surfaces and functional room dividers. We describe a menu and a widget-based approach in which functions are color-coded and can be selected by dragging them from module to module on the surface of the wall. We also propose an on-off switch gesture and a dial gesture each spanning multiple units as canonical input mechanisms that are realized in a fully distributed way."
