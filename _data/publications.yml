- title: "3DFS: deformable dense depth fusion and segmentation for object reconstruction from a handheld camera"
  description: "We propose an approach for 3D reconstruction and segmentation of a single object placed on a flat surface from an input video. Our approach is to perform dense depth map estimation for multiple views using a proposed objective function that preserves detail. The resulting depth maps are then fused using a proposed implicit surface function that is robust to estimation error, producing a smooth surface reconstruction of the entire scene. Finally, the object is segmented from the remaining scene using a proposed 2D-3D segmentation that incorporates image and depth cues with priors and regularization over the 3D volume and 2D segmentations. We evaluate 3D reconstructions qualitatively on our Object-Videos dataset, comparing to fusion, multiview stereo, and segmentation baselines. We also quantitatively evaluate the dense depth estimation using the RGBD Scenes V2 dataset [Henry et al. 2013] and the segmentation using keyframe annotations of the Object-Videos dataset."

- title: "Gesture based distributed user interaction system for a reconfigurable self-organizing smart wall"
  description: "We describe user interactions with the self-organized amorphous wall, a modular, fully distributed system of computational building blocks that communicate locally for creating smart surfaces and functional room dividers. We describe a menu and a widget-based approach in which functions are color-coded and can be selected by dragging them from module to module on the surface of the wall. We also propose an on-off switch gesture and a dial gesture each spanning multiple units as canonical input mechanisms that are realized in a fully distributed way."
