  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! My name is Naren. I was born and rased in Colorado, did my undergrad out in the cornfields
    of central Illinois in Computer Engineering, focusing on Machine Learning and Robotics,
    and lived in Northern California for a few years working on the development of self driving cars.
    Now I live in Los Angeles doing graduate school working on Human Robot Interaction, Reinforcement Learning
    and Embodied AI.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    I've worked on topics ranging from climate modeling, high performance computing, design,
    computer vision and systems (web, distributed, embedded and operating or some combination
    of those) but since I was in high school I have most passionate about thinking about and
    developing the interactions between one or many people and one or many robots or embodied agents (i.e. human
    robot interaction, swarm robotics, multi agent systems, and artificial intelligence). Hence
    a good amount of my academic work is centered around these ideas.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    I am also an advocate for Free and Open Source Software and Hardware. During my
    undergrad, I, along with a couple close collaborators worked on extending the ideas
    of the hackathon craze of the 2010s to address getting more students involved in the
    open source community. This resulted in HackIllinois becoming (to my knowledge) the
    first open source collegiate hackathon. Growing from a small pilot program to 1000+
    attendees a year, over the last 4 years 100s of Pull Requests, a few releases, and a
    whole lot of cool new open source projects and forks were created at Hackillinois, a
    lot done by first time open source contributors being mentored by core maintainers of
    projects like Debian, Rust, WebAssembly, Python, Julia and more.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    In my free time I'm an avid mountain biker (and road biker too I guess) as well as like
    to play tennis, soccer and rugby (got a few caps for Illinois while I was there). I was
    chair of the UIUC Chapter of ACM from 2016-2017, ACM@UIUC being the nations largest ACM
    student chapter and during my time there I created quite a few projects that ACM now
    maintains.

    I work at NVIDIA developing perception and other deep learning components for autonomous
    vehicles within the constraints of the resource limited environment of a car. I therefore
    use TensorRT a lot and ended up creating the TensorRT Python API (something that the
    TensorRT team now maintains and has vastly improved from its original versions) and worked on
    the open sourcing effort for TensorRT. I also created and am the lead maintainer of
    TRTorch, a compiler for PyTorch that targets NVIDIA GPUs via TensorRT. You can see a hint of the perception work we do by
    looking at NVIDIA's DevBlog.

    My research centers around collaborative systems between humans and embodied agents.
    This has included projects in the past on online learning during collaborative tasks and
    now giving robots the ability to pose human collaborators with a small demo task to
    demonstrate their preferences in approaching manipulation problems and transferring that
    knowledge to be better collaborators in complicated tasks. I also work on curriculum
    generation for reinforcement learning using evolutionary methods.
